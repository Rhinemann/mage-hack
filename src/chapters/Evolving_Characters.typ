During play, your character will change. Some changes will be temporary; others will last the rest of your character's career.


== Changing Milestones
By default, once you hit the 10 XP level of a milestone, the entire milestone is closed; after the session ends, the closed milestone is replaced with a new one. (In some cases, the ST may allow this “replacement” to just be a fresh copy of the milestone.)

New milestones can be created in collaboration by the player and ST, or chosen from those listed in Appendix C: Sample Milestones.


== Spending XP
Once experience points are earned via Milestones, they can then be spent for the benefit of your character. #title_content uses the following table for the most common uses of Experience Points:
