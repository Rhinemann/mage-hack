In addition to Hinder each character has a handful of SFX, reflecting special capabilities associated with their many different abilities, these are called talents. These A PC also has at least one Limit. A Limit is a special type of SFX that imposes a disadvantage on your character in order to earn them #c_sym.pp or another reward. Whenever you gain a Talent or Limit, you can rename it to better suit your character.
