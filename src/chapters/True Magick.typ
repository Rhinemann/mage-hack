= True Magick

#show: columns.with(2, gutter: 1em)

True Magick represents a character's ability to manipulate reality through their Awakened Will. Depending on the character's approach to magick alternative names for the trait set are possible, such as: Spheres, Enlightened Science, Ars Magia, Heka.

#block(breakable: false)[
  == Using True Magick
  Whenever a PC is attempting working their Will upon the world they must determine the possibility of an effect based on the Sphere rank they possess and the descriptions of their abilities and add the Sphere employed in the effect to the dice pool.
]

Every Working of magick opens a mage to all of the associated dangers, such as Paradox.

#block(breakable: false)[
  === Affinity Sphere
  The affinity Sphere is a mage's initial field of study and connection. It's a Sphere that a mage has the strongest connection to, the Sphere that is a mage's first connection to the greater truth of the world. The pull of an affinity Sphere can be felt form the childhood by most magi.
]

Every character has an affinity Sphere they choose at character creation depending on their Tradition and natural talent. Whenever a character is casting an effect that involves their affinity Sphere they may spend a #c_sym.pp to double the Sphere die in a roll.

#block(breakable: false)[
  === Conjunctional Effects
  Despite being immensely powerful even on their own, different Spheres can be combined to achieve truly spectacular and complicated effects.
]

Casting a conjunctional effect is no different from using one Sphere for creating an effect, a player must evaluate their Sphere ranks and descriptions to determine whether a desired effect is possible, then add only one Sphere die to the pool. Seeing as there are multiple Spheres involved, the choice of a Sphere is up to the player. Normally they can simply choose the highest Sphere available for the best success potential, but it might be more beneficial to choose a lower Sphere for a specific SFX it might have or if it's an affinity Sphere and can be doubled.

#block(breakable: false)[
  == The Spheres
  True Magick consists of 9 Spheres, each represents a character's ability to influence the specific area of the Tapestry.
]

#block(breakable: false)[
  === Rating Spheres
  Spheres are ranked #c_sym.d4 to #c_sym.d12, representing the depth and intricacies of the mage's understanding of it, and therefore their power to control it.
]

Powers provided by every Sphere's rank are unique, but tend to follow this overall progression:

/ #c_sym.d4 Initiate: An initiate grasps the essential principles and begins to perceive the ways in which that Sphere behaves. The mage can't alter anything just yet, but they can put their observations to good use.

/ #c_sym.d6 Apprentice: The mage begins to use the Sphere to make small alterations in their local reality. The mage begins to use the Sphere to make small alterations in their local reality.

/ #c_sym.d8 Disciple: Achieving a greater level of accomplishment, the mage can make notable changes to elements connected with the Sphere. Remarkable feats become possible, and the mage approaches the realm of true wizardry.

/ #c_sym.d10 Adept: An impressive command of the Sphere in question allows the mage to perform dramatic feats.

/ #c_sym.d12 Master: Magnificent feats become possible with such dominion within the Sphere. Literally godlike miracles greet the master of a Sphere, and Reality literally shapes itself to their whim.

#block(breakable: false)[
  === Sphere Talents
  True Magick is a powerful trait set, so every Sphere has a number of talents associated with it. These talents are unlocked automatically as a character gains the corresponding Sphere rank.
]

The specific talents for every Sphere are given after the rank description, but they follow this overall structure:

/ Sphere Perception: Step up your lowest die on any roll to perceive any phenomena under the purview of Sphere or create a related asset.

  You unlock this talent at Sphere rating #c_sym.d4 for that Sphere.

/ Sphere Manipulation: On rolls to create an asset that can be produced by a #c_sym.d6 or lower Sphere rating, add #c_sym.d6 and step up your effect die.

  You unlock this talent at Sphere rating #c_sym.d6 for that Sphere.

/ Sphere Control: Spend a #c_sym.pp to create a #c_sym.d8 asset that can be produced by a #c_sym.d8 or lower Sphere rating.

  You unlock this talent at Sphere rating #c_sym.d8 for that Sphere.

/ Sphere Command: Spend a #c_sym.pp to step up or double your Sphere die on a roll for an effect that can be accomplished by a #c_sym.d10 or lower Sphere rating.

  You unlock this talent at Sphere rating #c_sym.d10 for that Sphere.

/ Sphere Mastery: Take #c_sym.d6 appropriate stress or complication to double your Sphere die for for a roll. On a failure, step up the same stress or complication you took to activate.

  You unlock this talent at Sphere rating #c_sym.d12 for that Sphere.

#block(breakable: false)[
  === Correspondence
  #quote[Connections and Dimensions]

  By manipulating the ties between places, objects, and people, the Correspondence Sphere allows a mage to sidestep distances, sense things that would normally be out of range, pull objects out of thin air, levitate or fly, or connect an Effect to some other place or character. Some magi proclaim this Sphere is proof that distance is an illusion, whereas others view it as the Art of pulling strings between different places and people.
]

Most Effects require touch or close contact, but Correspondence lets the mage reach across distances and affect hidden or faraway targets. Tenuous connections require several successes, but spanning close connections is easy for a mage who understands this Art.

On its own, Correspondence allows the mage to reach across distances, even to places they cannot see or touch. At Rank #c_sym.d6 or higher, they can grasp items and work with them from a distance. To manipulate other objects or beings in ways other than physical contact, however, that mage must combine Correspondence with another Sphere -- typically a Pattern Sphere (Forces, Life, or Matter).

Despite its ability to warp space and distance, Correspondence deals only with whole Patterns, unless a target has been altered by another Pattern Sphere; Correspondence alone, for example, cannot teleport someone's head off -- the mage would need to use Life magick to separate the head from its body. A gun, on the other hand, could be snatched away by a Correspondence/Matter Effect.

Mages who specialize in Correspondence tend to have a faraway look. To them, the separations of space and form are meaningless illusions that disappear when you understand how the universe truly fits together.

#block(breakable: false)[
  ==== #c_sym.d4 Initiate
  #quote[Immediate Spatial Perceptions/Landscape of the Mind]

  Basic spatial understanding allows a mage to sense things in their immediate vicinity even if they cannot perceive them with their normal senses. Using that perception, they can estimate the distances between objects; intuitively find a direction (North, South, East, West); notice hidden objects or characters; and spot spatial instabilities -- warps, anomalies, wormholes, etc. -- especially the ones caused by other Correspondence Effects.
]

/ Correspondence Perception: Step up your lowest die on any roll to perceive any phenomena under the purview of Correspondence or create a related asset.

#block(breakable: false)[
  ==== #c_sym.d6 Apprentice
  #quote[Sense, Touch, Thicken & Reach Through Space/Correspondence Sensing]

  That mage can now extend their senses across intervening space, sensing things in other locations. Such extensions, however, leave minor ripples in space... the kind noticed by Rank #c_sym.d4 Correspondence. Fortunately, they can also thicken space to cover their tracks.
]

By adding Life or Matter to Rank #c_sym.d6 Correspondence, the mage can grasp small items or organisms (housecat-sized or smaller) and then pull them through tiny holes in space. This lets them snatch business cards, guns, rabbits, and such from another location, apparently pulling them out of nowhere.

/ Correspondence Manipulation: On rolls to create an asset that can be produced by a #c_sym.d6 or lower Correspondence rating, add #c_sym.d6 and step up your effect die.

#block(breakable: false)[
  ==== #c_sym.d8 Disciple
  #quote[Pierce Space/Open or Close Gates/Co-locality Perceptions]

  Now the mage can tear holes in space, large enough for them to step through. These minor gates are small and temporary, but they allow that character to step from one place to another, so long as they are alone and are lightly encumbered. (Teleporting large items, or while carrying heavy loads, demands Correspondence #c_sym.d10.) Scoping out the new location is a good idea, of course. A close, familiar destination is easier than a distant, unfamiliar one.
]

Using the Co-locality Perceptions Effect, the mage can also perceive several places at once. Those locations all appear as ghosts overlapping each other, as if they had been layered on top of the closest location.

In addition, by combining Correspondence #c_sym.d8 with Forces, Life, or Matter, the mage can move things around from a distance, levitating, manipulating or teleporting them without physical contact.

/ Correspondence Control: Spend a #c_sym.pp to create a #c_sym.d8 asset that can be produced by a #c_sym.d8 or lower Correspondence rating.

#block(breakable: false)[
  ==== #c_sym.d10 Adept
  #quote[Rend Space/Ward/Co-locate Self]

  Creating larger holes in space, the mage can now open permanent gates between locations; isolate forces, spaces, objects, or people into their own tiny realms (by combining Correspondence #c_sym.d10 with Forces, Life, Mind, or Matter); and ward certain locations against specific Patterns (again, combining Forces, Life, Mind, or Matter with Correspondence) or Resonance energies (combining this Sphere with Prime #c_sym.d10). This warding effect can impede or even block the forbidden elements from crossing into, or out of, the protected space. (For extensive details about wards, see the sourcebook How Do You DO That?)
]

Using the Co-location Effect, mage can also appear in several different places at once. To function, however, they must add Mind #c_sym.d4 to that Effect. Each self mirrors the original's actions unless they also add Life #c_sym.d6 to that Effect, granting independence to every self.

/ Correspondence Command: Spend a #c_sym.pp to step up or double your Correspondence die on a roll for an effect that can be accomplished by a #c_sym.d10 or lower Correspondence rating.

#block(breakable: false)[
  ==== #c_sym.d12 Master
  #quote[Spatial Mutation/Co-Location]

  Distance and dimensions become child's play to a mage at this Rank. they can distort space; alter sizes and stretch or compress objects (Matter), bodies (Life), or forces (Forces); connect different Patterns to one another across intervening space; or even superimpose places or objects on top of one another (extremely vulgar). Combining this Rank with Life #c_sym.d8, the mage may also expand their senses to perceive many different places at once.
]

/ Correspondence Mastery: Take #c_sym.d6 appropriate stress or complication to double your Correspondence die for for a roll. On a failure, step up the same stress or complication you took to activate.

#block(breakable: false)[
  === Entropy
  #quote[Chance and Mortality]

  Controlling the energies of probability and decay, an Entropy-schooled mage can manipulate random factors, observe and influence flaws within a system, tap into the energies of the Low Umbra, induce or remove corruption, and otherwise exert their Will through the unpredictable process of chaos.
]

Entropy describes what should or must happen, but not precisely when or how that result will come about (those are the province of Time). Fate governs blessings, curses, destiny, fortune, oaths, probability, luck, and intent.

This is no easy discipline. The Entropic mage assumes some of the Resonance of decay within their own Pattern, and bears the weight of mortality within their mind and soul. Still, the powers of this Sphere -- though less obviously destructive than those of other Arts -- give that mage subtle but pervasive control over Creation as a whole.

For obvious reasons, Entropy-schooled magi tend to be fatalistic, disassociated, or uncannily cheerful. To them, the saying “all things must pass” is no simple sentiment but an intrinsic fact.

#block(breakable: false)[
  ==== #c_sym.d4 Initiate
  #quote[Sense Flaws, Fate & Fortune/Ring of Truth]

  Basic Entropic understanding allows a mage to see the currents of probability, spot flaws in Patterns, and note the subtle yet telling details in a person's speech and behavior that suggest whether or not they're telling what they believe to be the truth. Although they cannot yet control such phenomena, the mage can predict dice throws, card draws, and other apparently random events; spot weak spots in objects, people, or arguments; and use those imperfect yet profound insights to their advantage.
]

/ Entropy Perception: Step up your lowest die on any roll to perceive any phenomena under the purview of Entropy or create a related asset.

#block(breakable: false)[
  ==== #c_sym.d6 Apprentice
  #quote[Control Probability]

  Now the mage can control the factors they could only sense before. Pulling the strings of apparently random events, they can influence activities and results -- directing the fall of dice or cards, repeatedly hitting weak spots, and directing people and things toward a conclusion of their choice. Of course, it is easier to control small events (the winner of a horse race) than large ones (causing a six-car pileup). In game terms, large alterations have higher difficulty than small ones do.
]

/ Entropy Manipulation: On rolls to create an asset that can be produced by a #c_sym.d6 or lower Entropy rating, add #c_sym.d6 and step up your effect die.

#block(breakable: false)[
  ==== #c_sym.d8 Disciple
  #quote[Affect Predictable Patterns]

  Things eventually break down. At this Rank, the mage can control the speed at which material objects fail or decay. That is easier to do with complex machines (cars, computers) than it is with simple ones (walls, stones) -- after all, more things can go wrong with complicated things.
]

At this Rank, the mage can also start controlling the fate and fortune of objects and people, giving them good or bad luck by controlling the probability of events around them. Again, large feats have higher difficulty than smaller ones.

/ Entropy Control: Spend a #c_sym.pp to create a #c_sym.d8 asset that can be produced by a #c_sym.d8 or lower Entropy rating.

#block(breakable: false)[
  ==== #c_sym.d10 Adept
  #quote[Affect Living Things]

  At this Rank, the mage assumes the awesome power of blessing, cursing, and conferring outright health or decay. By influencing the flow of entropy within a living body, that mage can grant outstanding vitality to, or inflict sudden disease upon, their subject. Such influence may grant long-term luck or misfortune. (GM's option as to how this manifests.)
]

/ Entropy Command: Spend a #c_sym.pp to step up or double your Entropy die on a roll for an effect that can be accomplished by a #c_sym.d10 or lower Entropy rating.

#block(breakable: false)[
  ==== #c_sym.d12 Master
  #quote[Affect Thought/Shape Memes/Binding Oath]

  The most esoteric applications of Entropy allow the mage to alter ideas, strengthening or breaking down concepts. Although they do not affect the actual workings of consciousness, they can cause synapses to misfire (thus confusing perceptions and mental processing, inflicting penalties on an enemy's dice rolls), bind someone to an oath, or degrade the patterns of thought. By doing so, that Entropic Master can create, perpetrate, reinforce, and undermine arguments, beliefs, and even memories.
]

To do such things, the Master merely speaks to, or glances at, the subject of their attention. Chaos Masters can scramble someone's perceptions with a few weird utterances, and Masters of Order can present arguments with apparently perfect logic. By offering compelling statements, the Master can create or destroy memes, thus influencing whole patterns of belief. An oath, meanwhile, ties the subject's fate to their loyalty; if they break the oath, then their luck goes really, really bad.

#block(breakable: false)[
  === Forces
  #quote[Raising Storms]

  Although modern physics disputes the old lines between matter and energy, the venerable study of Forces transcends human politics. This Sphere commands the energies of Creation, and its specialists are among the most powerful magi alive.
]

On a metaphysical level, the Forces Sphere commands energetic Patterns: fire, air, momentum, gravity, radiation, light, sound, and radio waves... the kinetic elements that shape and channel Earthly forces. Quintessence flows within such Patterns, so a mage can conjure new forces simply by adding some Quintessence to “empty space.” Different practices view such powers differently. Are they elemental spirits? Gods? Particles? Waves? Every Master has their or their own pet theory. In practical terms, however, this Sphere controls the Patterns of such forces -- directing, transmuting, enhancing, or banishing their effects upon this world.

Simple manifestations and manipulations are limited to the lower Sphere Ranks, whereas large-scale Effects demand higher levels of expertise. Most large Effects can become Paradox magnets for careless magi. Masters of Forces tend to carry a palpable aura of energetic command, with a Resonance that often alters their environments in uncanny, elemental ways.

#block(breakable: false)[
  ==== #c_sym.d4 Initiate
  #quote[Perceive Forces]

  Unlocking basic perceptions of the elements, a Forces-savvy mage can sense the flow of forces in their environment. they can boost their perceptions into the infrared or ultraviolet spectrums, notice electrons, see in the dark, view X-rays, discern the flow of sound or radio waves, spot kinetic energies, and hear frequencies beyond the normal human range.
]

/ Forces Perception: Step up your lowest die on any roll to perceive any phenomena under the purview of Forces or create a related asset.

#block(breakable: false)[
  ==== #c_sym.d6 Apprentice
  #quote[Manipulate Forces/Elemental Touch]

  Although they cannot conjure energies just yet, the mage may now alter the flow of existing forces. Sound can be muted or amplified; shadows can be gathered, shaped, or dispelled. The mage can warp light to make things invisible, change their colors by altering the spectrum of localized light, or render them silent by bending sound waves in their vicinity. With a wave of their hand, they can disrupt electrical currents; flare flames; or direct the course of winds, momentum, or gravity.
]

Combining this Rank with other Spheres, that mage could also make an object (Matter) or organism (Life) attract or repel forces. Thus, they could weave minor protection spells or force fields... or, conversely, turn that target into a magnet (perhaps literally) for the forces in question.

Despite its powers, this Rank is limited in scale. Assume that the mage can command energies around a single human-sized character or within a small area (20' or less). To affect a larger area, you need a higher Rank in Forces.

/ Forces Manipulation: On rolls to create an asset that can be produced by a #c_sym.d6 or lower Forces rating, add #c_sym.d6 and step up your effect die.

#block(breakable: false)[

  #quote[Transmute Minor Forces/Telekinetics/The Dragon's Touch]

  Now the mage can alter and invoke the energies they could only touch before. By adding Prime #c_sym.d6, they may conjure winds, fire, electricity, gravitational wells, and so forth. Combining this Rank with Life or Matter, they can transform people into electricity (Life #c_sym.d12/Forces #c_sym.d8); change water into air (Forces #c_sym.d8/Matter #c_sym.d8), or attach elemental force to material forms -- making them fly, pinning them to the ground, and having other, similar effects (generally with Life or Matter #c_sym.d8). In addition, by adding an ephemeral Sphere to this Rank, they might erode or enhance energies (Entropy #c_sym.d8); manifest thoughts into energies (Mind #c_sym.d8); transmute spirit-stuff into physical energies (Spirit #c_sym.d8); or set triggers for energy fluctuations at some later interval (Time #c_sym.d10). At this Rank, the scale of effect grows larger, now encompassing several dozen yards or a handful of characters.

  Larger Effects become possible. Our mage may now use the lower-Rank Effects over larger areas -- a mile or more -- to change weather patterns; conjure darkness; drop or raise temperatures; protect locations... or destroy them; and otherwise employ the previous levels on a much greater scale.

  With godlike power, a Forces Master works their Will upon vast areas. they can conjure tornados on a clear day, calm tides, and ignite the very air into a firestorm. Such magi earn the title “Nuke,” though few of them survive long enough to enjoy it. It's easier to invoke such forces under the right conditions, of course -- a cold snap comes more easily in winter than in summer -- and such radical alterations have repercussions that often outlast the original Effect. In game terms, massive Forces spells should disrupt the weather and leave massive Resonance echoes behind.

#block(breakable: false)[
  === Life
  #quote[The Living Form]

  Life grows, transforming over time until some final incident renders it into inert matter. magi who specialize in Life, therefore, master the complex principles of organic transformation. Beginning with the simplest Patterns, they evolve their understanding toward godlike ends. A true Master, therefore, may end life, but they may also create it from pure energy (that is, from Quintessence) or turn it, literally, to dust.
]

Whereas other Spheres grapple with abstract theories, Life focuses on literally bone-deep facts. As a Life mage knows, however, those facts remain susceptible to change. In conjunction with other Pattern Spheres (Forces, Matter), life forms can be changed into elements, turned to stone or metal, or else created from such substances. Even without additional Spheres, however, Life allows a mage to transmute those life forms in startling, even apparently impossible ways.

As a whole, this Sphere embraces everything that has living cells within itself, even if that object is technically dead. Generally, assume that anything that is still alive enough to transplant, preserve, or cultivate is governed by Life Arts. If it is inert enough to be irrevocably dead, then it is governed by Matter. Thus, preserved blood and organs, still-living plants, live-culture cheese, and so forth contain Life, but cotton fibers, withered organs, or cut wood become Matter.

An organism that has been radically altered by Life magick (given new limbs or other characteristics that are not part of the creature's original Pattern) suffers Pattern bleeding: an inexorable Quintessence leak that inflicts #c_sym.d6 Hurt stress per day. Unless the caster uses Prime magick to refill that Pattern with fresh energy, or alters that Pattern permanently, the damage continues until the subject dies.

Given their ability to heal illness, age, and harm, Life-skilled magi enjoy great health and vibrant beauty. Truly accomplished ones understand the mutable potential of organic existence and work to correct -- or exploit -- its ever-changing states.

  #quote[Sense Life]

  Basic Life knowledge allows a person to read the presence and health of nearby life forms. With such knowledge, the mage can discern a living being's age, sex, and overall health. By combining those perceptions with other Spheres, they can also sense distant organisms (Correspondence #c_sym.d6), guess their potential for sickness or misfortune (Entropy #c_sym.d4), perceive them through past or future states (Time #c_sym.d6), or read the streams of Quintessence that bind them to the universe (Prime #c_sym.d4).

Although they cannot yet transmute them into other states of being, they can cause flowers to bloom or wither, help trees bear fruit, and so on. Focusing on their own Pattern, they can also heal themselves or perform small alterations (hair color, skin tone, height, weight, and so on) to their basic form.

Working with their own Pattern, that mage can work substantial alterations on themselves, growing gills, claws, armor and so forth.

  #quote[Shaping the Materials]

  To a mystic, nothing is truly inert. Still, the Sphere of Matter deals with substances that possess no active agency of their own -- materials, not life forms or energies. The third aspect of the Pattern Trinity, Matter works best when combined with other Spheres. Prime and Matter create solid forms from energy; Correspondence and Matter connect objects across space; Entropy erodes or reinforces Matter; Forces transmutes inert elements into active ones. Spirit plus Matter renders ephemera into matter or matter into ephemera. Time alters the temporal state of Matter, and high-Rank Mind Effects (Rank #c_sym.d12) imbue inanimate materials with consciousness. Although Forces, Prime, and Spirit reflect primal energies and Life addresses organic animation, Matter represents the base of the physical world.
]

Matter-wise magi tend to share a literally hands-on approach to their Art. Solid workers of their practice, they favor practical results with even the most theoretical applications.

  #quote[Basic Transmutation]

  With advanced knowledge, the mage can transmute one substance into another, so long as they do not alter its essential shape, temperature, or basic state (gas, liquid, solid). Depending upon that mage's practice, they might reshape lead into gold through alchemy, wood into stone through a hyper petrification process, or water into wine (and, with Life #c_sym.d8, wine into blood) through a sacred miracle. Rare and/or complex materials are more difficult to fabricate than simple ones; it is easier to turn stone into iron, for example, than into gold.
]

(On a related note, the mage cannot yet fabricate radioactive materials. Such elements merge their essence into the Sphere of Forces, and thus demand a greater level of expertise.)

When combined with other Spheres, this basic level of understanding allows a mage to conjure base materials from energy or dissolve them into Quintessence (Prime #c_sym.d6); transmute matter into living tissue (Life #c_sym.d10 or higher); move an object through space (Correspondence #c_sym.d6 or higher) or time (Time #c_sym.d8 or higher); change ephemera into matter and matter into ephemera, or awaken the slumbering spirit within material objects (Spirit #c_sym.d8 or higher). In all cases, Matter #c_sym.d6 allows the mage to work with simple, homogenous, non-living substances. Complex mixtures of various elements usually require Rank #c_sym.d8 or higher, although simple combinations (like those found in bread, milk, paper, or gunpowder) are possible albeit more difficult.

Different principles can be combined in complicated ways, creating cybernetic machines or electrified gold. Complicated devices (guns, cars, computers) may be conjured out of empty space if the mage understands the principles behind such things (in game terms, possesses the proper Skills). As usual, though, complicated creations demand extended.

  Human beings perceive reality through complex interplays of consciousness. The Mind-mage, therefore, alters the realities of their fellow beings. Skillfully applied, such Arts can make a sane man mad, soothe demented minds, or even shuck the boundaries of flesh.

Though limited in its physical capacities, Mind is the ultimate coincidental Art. Its Effects remain essentially invisible unless they are combined with other Spheres. And although Mind Adepts can leave their physical bodies behind, such abilities remain unseen by mortal eyes.

Drastic acts of mind control (suicide, for instance) have especially high difficulty, as do Mind-based attacks against Night-Folk or other magi with the Mind Sphere. Therefore, weak-willed people may be influenced easily; determined folks can shrug aside the influence of all but the most dedicated Will-workers.

Mind-based Effects are generally coincidental, although especially flamboyant feats might be vulgar instead.

Literally “thought-full,” Mind-savvy magi possess mental clarity and unnerving perceptiveness. Some appear to drift in a sea of distractions, but the majority of them view the world with laser-focus intensity that penetrates illusions to reach their deeper truth.

  With basic mental magick, the mage learns to sense the emotions and surface impulses of other people. Although they cannot read specific thoughts, they are able to perceive psychic impressions about a person or (with Matter #c_sym.d4) a place or object. Through this perception, they can guess at the nature of weak Resonance signatures and read the stronger ones outright. Even without Resonance, that mage can scan auras, note mood shifts, discern truth from lies, or grasp someone's overall state of mind by way of a successful roll.

Meanwhile, the mage also learns to shield their own mind from the thoughts and emotions of other people, constructing mental barriers around their aura, emotions, and consciousness.

On a related note, they also learn how to multitask and absorb data with startling acuity. For a scene or two, they can even create a Mind Empowerment asset that concentrates their mental faculties.

Combined with Correspondence, Forces, Matter, or Life, they are able to employ telekinesis, pyrokinetics, and psychophysical assault, influencing objects, elements, or people with the power of their mind.

  #quote[Essence of all Things]

  By studying the raw energy of Creation, a student of the Prime Sphere learns to understand, manipulate, and absorb the Fifth Essence within all things. Also known as Odylic Force, Primal Energy, and Quintessence, this baseline energy fuels the Patterns of other forms -- Forces, Life, Matter -- and flows through the sublime essence of Spirit. A Prime-skilled mage, therefore, can create and destroy things at their essential level, power items of enchanted or Enlightened creation, and sustain their own life essence through their understanding of Primal Force.
]

Ripe with such energies, a Prime Sphere specialist pulsates with Primal Force. Unless they are working to suppress it (or has wiped their aura clean with high-Rank magicks), their Resonance bears strong signatures from their deeds. For better and worse, such a person embodies the primal Otherness that most magi possess -- the sense of being something more than most people ever dream of being.

When infusing their Quintessence into an object, that mage may also consecrate the object with their personal energy. When they shapeshift, steps sideways, or otherwise alters their Pattern's metaphysical nature, that consecrated object will then change with their. In the process, it also picks up their personal Resonance... which, because it both identifies them and becomes essentially connected to them, is not always a good thing.

Weapons or attacks infused with Quintessence through Prime #c_sym.d6 Effects may hurt and substances infused the same way may protect against such harm. On a related note, they may also -- with Life #c_sym.d6 for simple organisms, or Life #c_sym.d8 for complex ones -- consecrate a living thing at this Rank, as if that life form were an object described above.

Through similar applications of energy, the mage can also conjure a simple Body of Light: an idealized self-projected from ephemeral energy. Although this Body of Light has no substance or special properties (unlike the astral form described in Chapter Nine, p. 477), it presents a glowing holograph of the mage themselves.

  Reaching into the essence beyond Earthly life and matter, the Spirit mage explores the Otherworlds and deals with creatures beyond mortal understanding.

As a result, its Effects typically use the Gauntlet Ratings to determine the difficulty of their associated rolls.

Often affiliated with the shaman, Spirit magick is more eclectic than it often appears. A mage who specializes in this Sphere could be a primal devotee, a sophisticated theologian, a medicine-worker deeply versed in cultural traditions, an eclectic metaphysician, a modern Pagan, or anyone else who comprehends the rich world beyond material physics.

It has been said that time travel is impossible; however, that is not entirely true... it is just extremely difficult. Effects that involve going backwards in time are always vulgar, and stack the effects of Paradox. No wonder people who go back in time rarely return to speak of it!

As one might expect, a mage who manipulates the Time Sphere tends to appear distant from the moment at hand.

  Data is reality. Anyone who thinks otherwise is fooling themselves. Although this reality extends only about as far as electronic data or media, that reach is damned near worldwide these days. And through that connection, Data Sphere specialists can find, contact, and reach out to anyone on the grid. All it takes is time and a little bit of information, plus the knowledge and the Will to work it properly.
]

A Technocratic refinement of the Correspondence Sphere, Data remains the province of the Virtual Adepts, the New World Order, and the various allies they choose to share it with. Like all Spheres, its properties are meta-physical, extending beyond the realms of conventional reality. Although the Data specialist is, theoretically, just using the tools at their disposal, the greater reaches of this Sphere extend beyond the bounds of what should be possible, according to the Masses. It's not "magick", of course --- stop thinking such unmutual thoughts! It does, however, pull the strands of Information-Age technology in some pretty impressive ways.

In most regards, Data functions like Correspondence with regards to the powers at its disposal. The primary differences come through the elements of connection and the methods of its employment. To use Data-based Effects, the technomancer must collate data about the person or location they're trying to reach, and then have gear in place that can reach the subject of their attention. The more expertise that specialist brings to bear on the situation (that is, the higher the Data rating they have ), the easier it is for them to establish a connection with minimal amounts of data.

Because Data depends upon technological methods of information and connection, a target who's not on the grid cannot be affected by this Sphere. Given the current (and growing) extent of information technology, however, the Data can reach most people within the industrialized world... especially if they participate in social media, modern banking, or government processes.

A Data specialist knows their way around the technology of our age.

  Based upon the Tychoidian cosmology theories of the Void Engineers, Dimensional Science posits an Anthropic Principle Field in which the conscious human mind exerts a degree of control over its metaphysical reality space. Because of that Principle, lesser subdimensions have collected outside of Earthly space, losers in some contest of metaphysical Darwinism. The entities native to those subdimensions -- extradimensional entities, or EDEs -- strive to pass the Earthly barriers and infect the human world. And that's where Dimensional Science comes in, a method of asserting the Enlightened elements of the Anthropic Principle and keeping those EDEs out of human space.

In game terms, Dimensional Science is largely the same as the Spirit Sphere. Like other Technocratic Spheres of Influence, however, its Effects are bound to technological gear and viewed through a lens of science, not mysticism. Although Void Engineers still apply the term Umbrae to these subdimensions (considering them mathematical shadows of the human Consensus), the Dimensional Specialist's approach lacks animistic reverence, even though it features scientific awe.

Unlike Data, Dimensional Science remains largely exclusive to a single Convention: the Void Engineers. In many regards, it's a well-kept secret, propagated only through intense training at VE facilities. The Dimensional Specialist, then, is a man or woman of intense focus within a multilevel framework of thinking and perception. By outside standards, they appear paranoid... but of course, if you knew the things they knows about the pervasive nature of subdimensions and EDEs, you'd be paranoid too...

  Through applied principles and technologies, the specialist learns to perceive EDE presence and potential incursions, evaluate the characteristics of alternate dimensions and thickness of the barrier that keeps them outside the Consensus, and perceive the essential terrain in the pocket dimensions on the other side of that Gauntlet.

  At this level of expertise, the specialist can use radiation pulses, hypermath, and samples of transdimensional matter to grant access to those alternate dimensions. With the correct instruments, that specialist can send out artificial ripples into nearby subdimensions in order to attract EDEs and leave signals for other Dimensional Specialists.
]

Thanks to the hypermathematical models and recordings involved in Dimensional Science, a specialist can also manipulate the Gauntlet, raising or lowering it, even as low as 0 -- a feat mystic mages cannot duplicate. The Gauntlet 0 Effect lasts for only one scene, but it counters the punishment of the Dimensional Anomaly (that is, the Avatar Storm) if that phenomenon is still in play. However, the specialist themselves still suffers feedback damage as they work the Effect. (In game terms, they take the usual Avatar Storm damage, though they prevents other characters from taking it during that scene.)

On a related note, the specialist learns to also surround themselves (or, with the appropriate Spheres, other people or objects) with a transdimensional field; this, in turn, allows them to interact with subdimensions on a limited level (brief touch) without suffering harm from the Dimensional Anomaly.

  Increased understanding allows the specialist to step sideways into alternate dimensions, manipulate the paraphysical matter (that is, ephemera) of those dimensions, and -- with the correct weaponry -- send out destructive phase disruption fields of vibrations that disorient, injure, or disintegrate EDEs. (In short, their attacks can harm spirit entities.) Thanks to the Stun/Kill/Disintegrate settings on those weapons, they can choose whether to inflict different levels damage on Umbral targets... and although EDE's experience all forms of damage the same way, dimension-hopping humans and Deviant werebeasts do not.

  #quote[Alter Dimensional Topography/Dimensional Gateway/Stabilize Dimensional Field]

  Increased understanding and appropriate technologies help the specialist make lasting changes to alternate dimensions. Reworking the paraphysical constraints of a given space, they may craft pocket domains and dimensional walls in order to block or catch EDEs. A skilled specialist can do this even from the Earthly side of the Gauntlet, thus avoiding the effects of the Dimensional Anomaly. Using similar techniques, the specialist can also carve out rapid-transit paths; in game terms, this Effect cuts down the specialist's travel time within the Otherworlds.
]

The specialist can also open large gateways into the subdimensions, although the people passing through those gates suffer the effects of the Anomaly unless the Gauntlet has already been lowered to 0 by a Dimension Science #c_sym.d6 Procedure.

Channeling Primal Energy (Quintessence) through appropriate technology, the specialist can also strengthen the Enlightened Anthropic Principle enough to prevent Void Adaptation.

  Utilizing the ultimate applications of Anthropic Principle Fields, the specialist can generate their own Anthropic Field (with the right instruments, of course) that allows them to venture beyond both Horizons and venture into the Deep Universe. By crafting a reality bubble around themselves, that specialist can keep other Earthly beings alive with them as well and can engineer and pilot vehicles for Deep Universe travel.
]

Employing the arcane technologies of Cosmogenesis, that Master Specialist may also engineer and create Horizon Constructs and custom-designed and constructed EDE organisms. They must employ Primal Utility energies as well (often including Life and Matter if the EDE construct is to survive outside the subdimensions... that is, if it's going to be more than simple ephemera), but these cosmic computations allow Void Engineers to harness powers not unlike those of legendary gods.

  === Primal Utility (Prime)
  #quote[Investing Essential Energies]

  To the Enlightened Hypereconomist, Prime is not some ephemeral energy bubbling up from the cracks of the world. Instead, it's an energy field generated by Homo economicus: the ambitiously conscious human being who acts to further their self-interest. Related to the VE theory of Enlightened Anthropic Principle Fields (although they don't know it by that name), the Syndicate's hypereconomic theories see Quintessence energy rising from human interest and activity. People literally invest themselves in such ventures, and although they might not see the energy they create through such transactions, they can feel it... hence the sensations involved in feeling valued or worthless.
]

Whereas other Technocratic Conventions stick close to the “essential energies” model of Prime, the Syndicate's Primal Utility specialists understand the Sphere differently. In game terms, the applications are more or less the same. For a Syndicate character, however, Prime flows through investing and withdrawing energetic currency through Ventures (value-generating Nodes) that manipulate the metaphysical economies of human value. By accessing what they call “creation's credit rating”, the hypereconomist controls that currency, investing it where it does the most good... for them.

Perhaps the greatest edge granted to those who understand Primal Utility comes from the aforementioned Ventures. By investing in a Venture, the hypereconomist can draw Primal Energy (Quintessence) from a mundane business. In game terms, that business becomes a Node; if the character has a lasting personal connection with that Venture, then he's got access to that Node as well. Only a character with at least one dot in Primal Utility can access the Quintessence from that Venture; another mage might sense the energies but remain unable to access their power.

Prime-savvy hypereconomists always watch for invisible bottom lines. Attuned to the effects of Market Correction (Paradox) and the perpetual exchange of energies conducted through human intercourse (sexual and otherwise), they can spot value -- or the lack of it -- in the least obvious situations, and he knows how to get the most for their investments in whatever form they might manifest.

  ==== #c_sym.d4 Initiate
  #quote[Assess Primal Utility/Deposit Primal Utility/Exploit Primal Venture]

  Assessment analysis gives the hypereconomist a view of Prime flows, Resonance signatures, and applied metaphysical processes (that is, magick) in their vicinity. As with all other Technocratic Sphere Effects, this demands the correct instruments and training, although certain practices and instruments (especially dominion and hypereconomics) simply give the specialist a hunch about the energies in play. Some specialists see colorful flows of energy but dismiss such visions as simply mental constructs for an otherwise invisible process.
]

As with Prime #c_sym.d4, the hypereconomist can also invest such energies and can utilize the Prime Force generated by Ventures as well as other, more mystical sources of Quintessence.

  #quote[Create Gadgets/Perfect Material Exploitation/Primal Innovation]

  Through sophisticated uses of instruments and principles, the hypereconomist can modify existing materials with an energized-value buzz; they can even create something from nothing, thanks to the principle of increased worth. In game terms, this allows them to use the normal Prime #c_sym.d6 Effects, although the character still needs to have some technological source to facilitate their conjurations.

  Utilizing energetic manifestations called Currency (in mystic terms, Tass), plus efficient managerial skills, the specialist can employ a team to create permanent Devices with their Currency, restore their personal stock (Pattern) with Currency, and drain or refill Devices and storage batteries called Matrices (that is, Periapts) with their available Currency.

  #quote[Create Tass/Exploit Opportunity/Liquidate Assets]

  Skillful use of hypereconomics now allows the specialist to create Currency from free-flowing energy. Typically, this Tass involves precious materials, paper money, credit cards, or other items of value (paintings, stock certificates, bearer bonds, drugs, etc.). Unlike mystic mages (or other Technocrats), however, they can use only the energy generated by Primal Utility activities... and not, for example, charge up their Platinum card at the nearest Node.
]

By exploiting the Primal Opportunities called “wellsprings” in superstitionist jargon, that hypereconomist can also draw energy out of an exciting event rather than a consistent source.

On the flipside, they can also destroy material objects while divesting them of their value (Quintessence). Although the specialist cannot access this energy, they can keep other people from utilizing those resources. (“I'd sooner burn this warehouse down than let you have it…”)
