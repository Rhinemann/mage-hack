In a tabletop roleplaying game, each player takes on the role of one or more characters. The characters adventure through an imaginary world (which can range from the fantastical to the mundane), and the players use the game's rules to determine the results of their characters' actions. In Cortex, everybody contributes to the story, but at some point you break out dice, contributing just enough randomness so no one knows what will happen until events unfold during play.

== Example characters
Throughout the book there will be examples of play included, those examples feature the same players, ST, and characters for consistency. They are:
/ Rhinemann (he/him): A Storyteller.

/ Lydia (she/her): Fashionista Hermetic mage with small stature and large personality.

/ Aurelius (he/him): Studious Hermetic wizard balancing brilliance and madness and Lydia's grandson.

/ Sebastian Armrock (he/him): An anxious Etherite Scientist, making machinery that works on dubious scientific theories, an old friend of Lydia's.
