= #title_text
This is a tabletop roleplaying game inspired by rules originally published as #smallcaps[Cortex Lite], that was designed as a "generic" tabletop RPG to be used in any setting.

#title_content is compatible with _Cortex Prime_ roleplaying game system.

#title_content is an adaptation of Mage: The Ascension, a classic World of Darkness game about mages living in the shadows of a world akin to ours.
