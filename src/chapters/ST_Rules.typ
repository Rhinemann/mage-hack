#show: chapter.with(chapter_name: "ST Rules")
There's more to STing a game than learning the rules, but assuming you've got a handle on the basics, there are a few extra rules the ST needs to know in order to run #title_content games.


== Scene Framing
#title_content gives players a lot of power over their characters and what happens to them. The ST isn't an omnipotent narrator, just another player with specialized responsibilities, portraying the world and the creatures in it rather than one special character of their own. However, one major power the ST possesses is that they are the one who frames scenes.

To frame a new scene, the ST makes decisions based on the story so far. They determine where it happens, who is present, and what is already happening when the PCs arrive.

While you might have a rough plan, avoid all expectations as to how a scene might end or what the player will choose to do. Include elements you think will spur the PCs into action, but the goal isn't to move players along a predetermined track; play to find out what happens.


=== Scene Distinctions
Each scene can be framed with up to three scene distinctions, special traits that any character in the scene can include in their rolls (if a character has distinctions of their own, their player chooses whether to use a scene distinction or one of their character distinctions for each roll). Scene distinctions are rated at #d8, and can be used to earn plot points with #sfx[Hinder].

As a special rule, a character can include both a personal distinction and a scene distinction in the same roll, as long as one of the two distinctions is #sfx[Hindered].


== Scale
Sometimes, a creature or other part of the story differs from the player characters in power or size so dramatically that it commands an innate advantage (or disadvantage, if it is smaller or weaker). When necessary, an extra trait known as scale is assigned.

Scale ranges from #d4 to #d12. Most mages, Night Folk and humans, as well as most humans and animals, have a scale of #d6. Master mages and elder Night Folk have a scale of #d8. A creature with a higher scale isn't just larger or more powerful -- it is _many times_ larger or more powerful. In the film version of _The Fellowship of the Ring_, the heroes' long fight against the cave troll is a desperate one, because of the creature's massive superiority of scale (#d8 compared to the Fellowship members' #d6). In the later film in the series, _The Return of the King_, the Witch-King of Angmar is also of greater scale -- not because of his size, but because his level of power is beyond mortal ken.

When a character or other part of the story rolls against a PC of a different scale, the one with the greater scale includes their scale die in their dice pool. In addition, when you are the one with the greater scale, after you roll, you keep three dice to add together for your total, instead of just two. Obviously, this is a very powerful advantage.

A #d4 scale is likely never going to be rolled (since there is no lower rating), but it exists to represent creatures with a level of power or size far beneath the scale of normal humans. A small child or animal, or a similarly smaller and/or weaker creature, would have a #d4 scale. As a result, a PC would add a #d6 scale die to its rolls against such a creature, though in general the ST shouldn't bother having a PC make such a roll.

== Spending Peril Dice
The ST can remove dice from the peril pool, “spending” them for a number of uses during play, including:

*As plot points:* The ST can spend a die to obtain the same benefits for their STCs that a player gets for spending #pp for their PC.

*To add dice to a roll:* Before a die roll is made, the ST can remove one or more peril dice from their pool, then add those die to the roll.

*For surprise entrances:* To introduce a new STC to a scene mid-conflict, the ST can spend a peril die equal to the new STC's highest trait.

*For sudden changes:* The ST can add a new scene distinction mid-scene by spending a #d8 or higher.

*To interrupt the action order:* When a player would take a turn, the ST can have a STC or challenge take their turn first by spending a peril die. This only works if the die spent is equal to or larger than the #trait[Scout] trait of the character the ST is interrupting.

*To split the PC group:* The ST can spend a #d10 or larger peril die to announce a sudden event that divides the party (such as a sudden building collapse, a huge crack opening in the street, a massive car crash, etc.)

*To immediately end the current scene with dramatic twist* The ST has the power to end scenes. However, if they want to end the scene in a cliffhanger or defeat for the PCs, or in a similarly dramatic fashion that the PCs might otherwise try to prevent, the ST can do so by spending #d12#d12.

== Storyteller Characters (STCs)
To help you make sure you don't do more work than necessary when creating STCs, the rules divide them into different types depending on the role you expect them to fulfil in the story.


=== Storyteller Characters
#title_content presents a world where mortals live in relative peace, but the secret world of the mages and Night Folk is full of conflict and dangerous rivalries. During a session, some STCs are meant to be challenging opposition, but others are bit parts and recurring secondary characters, so there are different ways of creating STCs.

STCs are split into three different types depending on the role you expect them to fulfil in the story: Extras, Analog STCs, and Challenge Pools.

Extras can be created as needed during play. Analog STCs and Challenge Pools work best for recurring characters who harry the player characters across multiple adventures. These may start as Extras or as Boss challenge pools; you can switch their type between sessions, and even use them as an Analog STC for a few adventures and then turn them into a Boss for a final showdown.


==== Extras
An extra is a nameless character in a scene who has just one trait describing their role in the story, like #trait[Bored Cop] #d10 or #trait[Suspicious Neighbour] #d6. This trait is added to other dice pools (such as the peril pool) rather than rolled on its own. When extras take a complication or stress larger than their trait die, they are taken out. Most extras are invented during play rather than created in advance.


==== Analog STCs
These are created much the same way you'd make a player character, although they can be simplified from that format. For example, instead of defining every trait in a trait set, they might only have the traits they are likely to use. Analog STCs may have whatever number of SFX or Limits seem appropriate (though generally not more than the ST can easily keep track of). They are taken out with stress or complications in the same way as a PC.


==== As Challenge Pools
A challenge pool is something the PCs have to deal with, and not only can it represent a STC, but also a hazard, dilemma, crisis, or anything else that could be an obstacle to the characters' progress. Challenge pools are the basic building blocks of #title_content adventures, and they are described in their own section.


==== Upgrading STCs
If a STC's importance grows beyond initial expectations, you can always switch their type between sessions as the developing story requires. You can even convert a STC into a challenge pool or vice-versa.


=== STCs and Dice Pools
When a PC rolls a test where a STC might interfere with or oppose that roll, the ST can add one or more STC traits to the peril pool before rolling. If a PC acts directly against an analog STC or challenge pool, the ST usually builds a dice pool based on traits just as a PC would and rolls that as opposition, instead of rolling the peril pool.


#colbreak()
== Challenge Pools
A challenge pool represents a complex and difficult situation that requires sustained effort to overcome, rather than any single action. It can represent any crisis or series of obstacles the PCs face: a forest fire, breaking into a vault, escaping police pursuit, dispelling complex magical wards, rescuing people from a collapsing structure, steering a raft down rocky rapids, negotiating the various rivalries and agendas at a social event, etc. Powerful foes or groups of enemies can also be represented by challenge pools.

Challenge pools are the basic structure around which #title_content adventures are built. A handful of challenge pools (including bunch of mobs, and one or two bosses, as described in this section) is all you need to tell a compelling story that lasts for an entire session.

The core of every challenge is a pool of dice that the players will step down and remove as they address the situation. This is its Challenge trait. The challenge remains a driving element of the story until the last die is removed from its pool.


==== Opposing The Challenge Pool
Player characters can use their action to reduce the challenge pool. When they do so, the entire challenge pool is rolled as a reaction against them. Usually, a PC tries to reduce the challenge pool by inflicting some kind of complication or stress on it.

However, challenge pools don't actually gain complications or stress, nor do they gain assets. Whenever a PC would inflict stress or a complication on a challenge pool, the player instead compares their effect die to a challenge pool die of their choice. If the complication or stress is bigger than that die, that die leaves the pool. If it isn't, the chosen die steps down. Similarly, whenever a challenge pool would gain an asset, that asset immediately converts into a new challenge die instead. When the last challenge die is removed, the challenge is defeated.

Trying to reduce a challenge pool is risky, however. Failing a roll to do so inflicts stress on the PC, just as failing a test would, but instead of a #d6, the ST can choose to inflict the challenge pool's effect die as stress.

Also, when a player hitches against a challenge pool, instead of giving the player a #pp, the ST may spend a die from the pool's challenge trait to turn the hitched die into a complication on the PC.


==== Challenge Pool Actions
The PCs face challenge pools in action order, and once every PC has had a turn, the challenge pool gets a turn as well. Usually, it rolls to inflict stress or create a complication, but it can also roll to create an asset for itself (which becomes a new challenge die).

Instead of rolling, the challenge can use its turn to step up its smallest die or grant the ST a #pp. The ST narrates how the challenge escalates or worsens, and then play moves on.

Finally, the ST can use the pool's turn to spend a die from the challenge trait and move a PC's complication to the challenge pool to replace it. The PC no longer has the complication, but the problem they were dealing with is now everybody's problem! (Obviously, the optimal use of this move by the ST would be replacing a smaller die with a larger one.)


==== STCs Vs Challenges?
If a challenge pool works against a STC, or vice-versa, or if STCs work against each other, the ST has two choices. They can let a PC roll determine the outcome, or they can simply decide what happens. GMs never roll dice against themselves.


=== Building Challenges
The ST creates the challenge pool by choosing three to six dice of the same size, from #d6 to #d12. Die size describes difficulty, while the number of dice roughly determines how long the challenge will last.

A #d6 #d6 #d6 challenge pool will probably be quick and easy, while a pool of #d12 #d12 #d12 #d12 #d12 #d12 is likely to be long and difficult.

If you wish, you can also give a challenge pool other traits or SFX, just like a STC, but that isn't necessary if you'd rather keep things simple for yourself during play.


==== Mobs
A mob is a challenge pool variant representing a group of opposing characters or creatures: a pack of werewolves, a gang of thugs, anti-government terrorists, rioting cops, summoned demons, etc. A mob's challenge pool is called its Mob Dice and this trait sometimes gets a colourful name.

Instead of stepping down its dice, mobs take complications like STCs. When a complication steps up past the Mob Trait's die size, the mob loses a die from that trait and the complication is eliminated. When Mob Trait loses its last die, it is taken out.

A mob also has signature assets in addition to its mob dice (like those of a minor STC), which it can add to its rolls. Mobs can also have SFX, and most have at least one SFX like #sfx[All-Out Attack], #sfx[Area Spell], or #sfx[Impossible to Ignore] that allow the mob to target multiple characters on its action.


==== Bosses
A boss is a variation that represents one STC meant to challenge multiple PCs at once. A boss works exactly like a mob except that instead of a Mob Dice trait, it has Boss Dice trait.


==== Organization
A organization works much like a mob, but it is a much larger group operating on a level beyond what any single individual (even a mage) can do. Secret societies, military forces, spy networks, organized crime, oligarch families, corporations, covert rebellions, insidious cults, police forces, and occult conspiracies are examples of organizations. A organization possesses a scale trait of #d8 or higher, giving it a powerful advantage when acting against the PCs. An organization has a Org Dice trait just like a mob has a Mob Dice trait.


==== Levelling Challenges
Tailoring dice ratings is more art than science. A challenge pool with fewer dice takes less time than a challenge pool with more. A challenge pool of larger dice will take more time still and will also require the PCs to tap more resources and push harder to bring down those dice. Larger ratings of signature assets, which rarely change, make the challenge harder still.

Additionally, the player characters may have traits and SFX that make them more effective against specific threats. A ghost-hunting exorcist is going to defeat a mob of poltergeists much faster than they would an equally-rated mob of well-armed mercenaries on the hunt, whereas a veteran Flambeau wizard armed with his amulets and wand will have a much easier time dispatching the mercenaries.

The best way to crack this chestnut is play. Throw a #d6 #d6 #d6 #d6 #d6 mob at the players, followed by a #d8 #d8 #d8 #d8 challenge, and then a #d10 #d10 #d10 boss. Jot down notes as to how quickly they go down. Iterate for the next adventure. You will very shortly develop a good sense, not only of how long and difficult any given encounter will play out, but how well it fits into your friends' expectations of play and attention spans.

== Sample STCs and Challenge Pools
These are some example enemies, allies, and challenges that you can use in your games. STCs and Challenge Pools can also be a useful shortcut to creating an adventure. Come up with a handful of these, figure out a situation that weaves them together and makes life tough for the PCs, and you pretty much have what you need to run a game session.

The dice in each challenge's main trait (like its mob trait or boss trait) are just a suggestion, which you should feel empowered to change. Part of the ST's job is deciding what die ratings to assign to challenge pools in order to best tailor the challenge to PCs.
