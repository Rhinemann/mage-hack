Choose one of the factions described in the following pages to define your character's alliances and their place among their fellow mages. A faction grants your character a signature asset, one or more specialities, and access to a specialized list of faction SFX. Though a faction does not grant a free SFX, during character creation you can use the bonus enhancement all PCs receive to gain one of your faction SFX.
