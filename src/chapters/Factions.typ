== Traditions
The Council of Ten Mystic Traditions, or simply the Traditions, are the default player characters and protagonists in the #title_content. The Traditions are a collection of magical traditions united by a common theory of magical Spheres, as well as a common purpose: the defence of magic and myth against the oppressive, static and safe Technocratic paradigm of predictability and control.

The council has traditionally maintained a seat for each Sphere, with certain Traditions (the Solificati and Ahl-i-Batin) leaving the council, only to be replaced by newer Traditions (the Sons of Ether and Virtual Adepts), and gain a new one with the introduction of the Death Sphere (Hollow Ones).

=== Akashayana/Akashic Brotherhood
The Akashic Brotherhood, also known as the Akashayana Sangha ("Order of the Vehicle of Akasha") or just the Akashayana, is a Tradition of mages masters of mind, body, and spirit pursuing the arts of personal discipline.

They believe that mind, body and spirit are all part of the larger whole of the person, just like at the same time that person is part of the whole of the universe. In other words, conflict, is an illusion, and the same can be said of identity and dispute, so when mind and body harmonize, the soul follows them. By honing their bodies, these mages make a temple for the mind that ultimately brings the comprehension of the spirit. The Brotherhood uses simple tools --- exercise, meditation, practice and study --- to refine the simple man into a brother of knowledge.


==== Focus
"Magick" is actually self-perfection and cosmic harmony. To master such Arts in the proper Way (Do), a person must expand awareness in all things, clarify thoughts, focus the body, and subdue emotional confusion. Asian alchemy, craftwork, faith, yoga, social dominion, and martial arts training allow a Brother to channel life energy (_chi_) toward astounding feats of physical, mental, and energetic achievement. /* As a result, common paradigms include _Bring Back the Golden Age_, _Everything's an Illusion_, _It's All Good_, and occasionally _Might is Right_. */

=== Celestial Chorus
The Celestial Chorus is a Tradition of mages united by their efforts to touch the Divine as well as their belief in the One and Prime from which all things originate.

Closely tied to the God of Abrahamic faiths (although its beliefs actually originate from the Ancient Egyptian monotheistic god Aten), the One represents the source of all Creation and all Creation is believed to be a part of the One. Humans in particular carry shards of the divine within them, though it is known by many names: the divine flame, the soul, the Avatar. It is this connection which the Celestial Chorus believes enables them to clearly hear the One's song and to shape Creation.

While their faith is essentially monotheistic, it is accepted that the Divine has many facets , so members of many faiths and denominations (including a variety of soft polytheists) come together in worship and service of the One, accepting that each person has their own path to the One, despite the Singers' history of martyrs, holy wars, division and compromise, sacrifice and resurrection.


==== Focus
The Arts flow not from personal achievement or intent but from faith, unity, and harmony with the Divine Will. Singing -- especially many voices joined in harmony -- provides this Tradition's oldest and most important instrument. Chorister magick tends to manifest in light, fire, warmth, harmonic vibrations, and sublime music. Faith and High Ritual form the core of Celestial Chorus practices. /* , so the group's paradigms include _Creation is Divine and Alive_, _Divine Order and Earthly Chaos_, and, of course, _It's All Good -- Have Faith_. */

=== Cult of Ecstasy/Sahajiya
The Cult of Ecstasy (also known as Sahajiya, a term derived from the Sanskrit word Sahaja which literally means spontaneous or natural) is a Tradition of mages and visionary seers who transcend boundaries and limitations through sacred experience.

To achieve that, the Cult uses things like drugs, music and sex, but they are just means to an end. The objective is to achieve a mental state that transcends the physical world, a trance that allows the mage to see beyond his normal experience and go outside all the lines that keep most people and mages penned in. Cultists take the word ecstasy in its original meaning: a sudden, intense rush of feeling that catapults the subject into an altered state. It does not have to be a pleasant feeling, but given a choice, most Cultists definitely prefer it that way. The Cult of Ecstasy breaks down barriers and self-imposed limitations to give people a rush of eye-opening experience.


==== Focus
"Get out of your own way" sums up the Ecstatic paradigm. To touch the Lakashim ("Divine Pulse"), a person must blow open the doors of inhibition and fear. Magick is the communion between a focused mind and the Lakashim -- a dance of possibilities directed by crazy wisdom. To perform it, an Ecstatic guides life force with conscious but flexible intentions. Ideally, a mage operates in a flux state in which neither time nor inhibitions block the life force -- aware of what they're doing and yet open enough to do anything.

The Cult's infamous substances and stimulations are meant to blast away any obstacles to Enlightenment, at least in theory. In reality, those same tools can become obstacles in their own right. Smart Ecstatics, then, keep shifting their tools around to avoid stagnation and constraints. Crazy wisdom is the core of this group's many practices, which include everything from gutter magick, yoga, and martial arts to cybernetic hypertech. /* And so, paradigms include _Creation's Divine and Alive_, _Everything is Chaos_, _It's All Good_, and quite often _Everything's an Illusion_. */

=== Dreamspeakers/Kha'vadi
The Dreamspeakers (also known as Kha'vadi) are a Tradition of mages consisting of individuals who practice shamanism, communing with spirits as part of their magic and existing as intermediaries between the Mortal World and the Spirit World.

It is one of the most diverse Traditions, with those representing the ancient cultures of African, Native American, Inuit, and Aboriginal Australian societies standing alongside practitioners of Shinto, independent spiritual savants, and descendants of other forgotten tribes and civilizations. Though originally shoehorned into a single group by the other, Eurocentric Traditions, the disparate cultures within the Dreamspeakers have found common ground in their respect for and dedication to the balance between physical and spiritual reality.

As the Gauntlet has grown thicker and the Spirit World more dangerous, the shamans' duties have become increasingly harder. But whereas other mages tend to overlook matters of spirit and Sleepers forget them altogether, the Dreamspeakers were born to walk the middle ground; to see and hear what others do not, and to fill roles still very much needed in the modern world.


==== Focus
Medicine, not magick, is the essence of Dreamspeaker Arts. An avatar is Howahkan: the mysterious voice that speaks to those who are ready to hear it. Sorcery is an egotistical and ultimately destructive Path that leads people away from the Good Road of harmony with the World Spirit. To reach past the illusions of mortal life, one must listen to Creation's heartbeat, face death, and remain open to the voice through which all life speaks.

Practice-wise, 'Speakers favour medicine-work, craftwork, shamanism, crazy wisdom, and faith. A few pursue cybernetics, yoga, Voudoun, and witchcraft, but their companions often shun them. /* Common paradigms include _A World of Gods and Monsters_, _Creation's Divine and Alive_, _Bring Back the Golden Age_, and sometimes _Might is Right_. */

=== Euthanatoi/Chakravanti
The Euthanatoi, also known as the Chakravanti ("People of the Wheel") or the Niyamavanti ("People of our Rule") are a Tradition of mages intimately devoted to the forces of death, rebirth, destiny, and karma in the world. They represent a collection of thanatotic cultists, necromancers, priests of fate, assassins, scholars, gamblers and healers.

Euthanatos mages embrace the role of death in the world as that which cleanses and makes way for future growth. Most believe in the reincarnation of souls, meaning death in one life is not to be feared and in fact may be crucial to one's spiritual development. Even those who do not share this belief recognize a continuous cycle of death and rebirth throughout life, and accept that at times death may be necessary to end suffering. These mages guard the moment between life and death. Guardians of reincarnation, they see Creation as a spinning Wheel of Death and Rebirth. When something, or someone, interferes with it, the obstacle should be removed. The method of removal may be as simple as a kind word or as final as murder.

Most controversially, many Euthanatos see it as their duty to push this cycle forward, removing sources of disease, corruption, and misery from the world in order to quicken the turn of the Wheel of Ages. This means judging when a person's moral degradation has grown too harmful to themselves or others to be allowed to continue, and when it is appropriate to deliver the Good Death.

Euthanatos are not cavalier about this responsibility, and are painfully aware of the risks, but they know their work is necessary and that they are the only ones for it. To the Euthanatoi, their duty is sacred, one that must be carried out, but is so strenuous and terrible that only the most strong-willed can perform it. It is not so much that they take on a right, as they take on a burden: responsibility for pain, for release and for renewal.


==== Focus
As masters of life, death, Fate, and Fortune, the Euthanatoi view magick as an extension of the Cycle. By turning the Wheel, these mages control probability as well as the forces of mortality. That turning focuses on the cyclical nature of existence, and so a Chakravat uses practices and instruments like crazy wisdom, faith, High Ritual, medicine-work, reality hacking, martial arts, shamanism, and occasionally Voudoun to direct those energies toward the desired end. Yoga has an essential place in this Tradition's Arts. /* _Divine Order and Earthly Chaos_ might be the group's most common paradigm; others include _Everything's an Illusion_, _Creation's Divine and Alive_, and even, believe it or not, _It's All Good -- Have Faith_. */

=== Hollow Ones
The Hollow Ones is the Tradition of cast-aways of modern society, those who reject establishment and the flawed order it brings, united by the ideals of Art and True Romance, but disparate in its forms.

Long considered a Lost Tradition, the Hollow Ones dwell in the underbelly of the world, among the undesirables and dregs who couldn't find purchase elsewhere, in societies both mundane and hidden. These Hollow Men focus on earthly matters, rejecting the notions of Ascension that the world of Awakened finds itself bogged down in. It is no surprise then that the Tradition lacks any kind of centralised Paradigm, instead using whatever mystic practice they can get their hands of, modifying or deliberately bastardising them in the process. No Hollow One is alike, expressing their void in their own way and in this they find unity of purpose.


==== Focus
Darklings use whatever they've got to work with -- typically things discarded by society. Broken toys, occult goodies, and symbols and behaviors that so-called respectable people shun make potent tools in the hands of a Hollow mage. Belief-wise, that hollow image is appropriately symbolic: these folks tend to see themselves as vessels of life and death, pouring their Arts out or carrying those cosmic forces from place to place. Magick, then, comes from the proper comprehension and intentional use of the energies that, in most people, are simply wasted. /* _Everything is Chaos, an Illusion, or a Mistake_, probably on a _One-Way Trip to Oblivion_. Some Hollowers insist that _It's All Good_, but they're the minority. */ Chaos and gutter magick are near-universal among the Hollow Ones. Although such Arts don't actually nurture chaos, they thrive in the chaos of our age.

=== Order of Hermes
The Order of Hermes is one of the pillars of the Traditions. A Fellowship during the Dark Ages, it draws upon a potent fundus of magical knowledge and has shaped occult history to great deals.

Its failings, however, are equally grand. Hubris runs strong within the elitist Order, and with the Reckoning, many of their traditional ways are challenged. Old, carefully hoarded secrets are gone forever in many cases, while mystical items and powerful patrons are destroyed or locked away beyond the hostile Gauntlet. The survivors on Earth can only hope to remember their teachings and learn all that they can. The Order will survive, but it may not be the same Order that it once was.


==== Focus
A Hermetic mage commands nothing less than the keys to the universe. And so, these consummate scholars master ancient and arcane rituals through constant study and intense practice. Tapping elemental currents through incantations, signs, seals, paraphernalia, and secret languages, the Hermetics are -- by necessity -- secretive and suspicious. They command tremendous power, after all, and their rivals lurk everywhere.

Alchemy, dominion, and High Ritual form core practices within the Order's ranks. No Hermetic mage lacks such training. Certain Hermetics add chaos magick, the Art of Desire, hypertech, craftwork, weird science, yoga, and occasional maleficia to that core./* , pursuing such paradigms as A Mechanistic Cosmos, Divine_ Order and Earthly Chaos_, _Might is Right_, _Tech Holds All Answers_ and, naturally, _Bring Back the Golden Age_. */

=== Society of Ether/Sons of Ether
The Sons of Ether (renamed the Society of Ether in the Modern Nights) are a group of technomancers aligned to the Council of Ten. Originally part of the Order of Reason and the Technocracy, they abandoned their former compatriots after the Union aided the expulsion of the Luminiferous Ether from the Consensus. Since then, the Sons have adopted several outdated technologies and incorporated them into their Paradigm.


==== Focus
Science! Or, more accurately, an imaginative grasp of natural principles channeled through established physical and energetic technologies. Earthier than their Virtual Adept colleagues, these technomancers prefer to employ Science that can be seen, held, demonstrated, and confirmed even by the eyes of fools. To that end, Etherite Science is showy, romantic, and gracefully futuristic, even if that future looks more like classic science fiction than like mundane science fact.

As a practice, an Etherite may use anything that seems to work. Most Scientists, however, favor gloriously esoteric variations on alchemy, craftwork, cybernetics, hypertech, reality hacking, and, of course, weird science. /* Paradigms focus largely around concepts like _A Mechanistic Cosmos_, _Everything is Data_, _Might is Right_, and _Everything's an Illusion_, but they usually boil down to _Tech Holds All the Answers_. */

=== Verbena
The Verbena is a Tradition of mages dedicated to preserving the ancient crafts and wisdom passed down over the ages by witches and warlocks, druids and druidesses, mystics, and priests and priestesses of the Old Gods.

Though modern Verbena have some similarities to Wiccans, they are inheritors of far older legacies from disparate cultures originating around the world. Regardless of their many differing faiths and customs, the Verbena share many principles in common. This includes a deep respect for the Earth and the natural order, a holistic view of people and the world as intrinsically intertwined, and the belief that power and understanding can be found by embracing life in all its passions and pains.

Of all the Traditions, the Verbena are perhaps most challenged by the changes brought to the world by advancing technology and expanding civilizations. Each member must find a way to apply the lessons and practices of the old ways to the modern world, or be seen by both mages and mortals as merely a fringe practitioner of a dying craft.


==== Focus
Verbena Arts concentrate on doing a lot with very little. Their tools are practical as well as symbolic, with uses that reach back to antiquity. "Pagan" in every sense of that word, these magicks hold deep ties to Nature. Shape-changing, transformation, healing and injury, divination, purification, growth and withering, natural cycles, and the tricky ways of Fate are witch-folk specialities.

/* To all Verbenae, _Creation's Divine and Alive_. Because Creation, life, and divinity aren't particularly nice, other common Verbena paradigms include _A World of Gods and Monsters_, _Might is Right_, _Bring Back the Golden Age_, and _Everything is Chaos_. */ Witchcraft is the group's core practice, with certain individuals favouring Voudoun, dominion, weird science, chaos magick, yoga, martial arts, High Ritual, cybernetics, the Art of Desire, craftwork, medicine-work, and even organic hypertech.

=== Virtual Adepts/Mercurial Elite
The Virtual Adepts (also known as the Mercurial Elite) are the second youngest members of the Traditions, already alienated from the Technocracy after the second World War for their nonconformity the execution of their ideological leader, an elite mathematician mage Alan turing they defected to the Traditions. Focused on the Digital Web, the Adepts search for a way to reach the singularity, the point where mankind can transcend into something post-human.

Digital anarchists, hackers of reality and technology, brilliant mathematicians and many more, they are some of the biggest enemies of Technocracy. Virtual Adepts are the ones who subvert and take apart the systems under Technocratic control to learn their function and and counter them.


==== Focus
/* _Everything is Data_. Thus, in this _Mechanistic Cosmos_, */ Every tool or practice an Adept employs focuses on shaping, altering, manipulating, gathering, storing, collating, influencing, or destroying information. Such tools range from the obvious computer gear (generations ahead of conventionally available tech), clouds, holograms, implants, nanotech, energy drinks, and sense-altering stimuli to the understated chic of dark hoodies, manga-influenced haircuts, fashionable androgyny, and provocative masks. All Adepts, however, keep the implements of their technomagick handy. For many Adepts, computers are a more important part of one's identity than any attire or accessory. An Adept's personal devices are almost always the most heavily customized and stylized elements of that Adept's ensemble.

Perhaps the most accomplished reality hackers alive, this Mercurial Elite also employs various forms of cybernetics, hypertech, weird science, martial arts, chaos magick, gutter magick, and sometimes shamanism, Voudoun, crazy wisdom, or witchcraft with a technological flair.

== Technocracy
The Technocratic Union, or the Technocracy (also called the Hidden Ones or the Five Metal Dragons) are the bitter rival and enemy of the Traditions.

They were initially founded as the Order of Reason in 1325, a group dedicated to the protection of humanity from the depredations of the supernatural -- specifically Mages, and more specifically the Order of Hermes.

Now the Technocratic Union enforces global order under their Enlightened guidance and protection. Dedicated to wiping out Reality Deviants, they've spent over 500 years at war with the mystic Traditions, wonder and nonconformity.


#pagebreak()
=== Iteration X
The Iteration X are engineers, technicians, inventors, and the mighty production forge of the Technocracy. Experts in technology that is beyond any scientific understanding of the Masses, they use advanced theories of physics, hypertech, AI to expand the boundaries of inorganic sciences, and improve the human condition with the cold, calculated efficiency of steel, microchip, and cybernetic implant.


==== Focus
The core of Iteration X science comes from the synergy between organic, mechanical, social, mathematical, and psychological elements. And so, cybernetics, craftwork and hypertech forge the foundation of this group's practices. Innovative Iterators employ martial arts, social dominion, hypereconomics, and reality hacking -- after all, even perfection must be flexible! A few even hold a demi-religious faith in the ultimate potential of The Machine; these days, though, they don't often discuss that out loud.

// _A Mechanistic Cosmos_ presents the obvious paradigm for Iteration X. Clearly, _Tech Holds All Answers_. Math-inclined members of this Convention assure their comrades that _Everything is Data_. This group has no use for "fuzzy" paradigms, so the Sphere of Dimensional Science is an extremely rare discipline among its ranks.

=== New World Order
The New World Order, often shortened to N.W.O., are the secret police force within the Technocracy, dedicated on shaping and guiding information in progress with the Collective Will of the Masses. The New World Order is responsible for much of processing of Reality Deviants and advancing the goals of the Time Table.


==== Focus
/* In _A World of Gods and Monsters_, _Might is Right_ and _Tech Holds All Answers_. */ Social dominion and the command of consciousness -- that is, the influence, harnessing, programming, and reprogramming of the homo sapiens mind -- provides the cornerstone of this New World Order's techniques. To that end, psychic training, information manipulation, perceptual conditioning, and symbolic connections (like a man wearing a formal black suit and carrying a badge) provide the essential tools for NWO Procedures. Physical media constitute the second level of manipulation, with the third and most brutal level -- force -- channelled through guns, armour, gadgets, hypertech vehicles, advanced weaponry, and the martial arts training all operatives receive. Paranoia, however, is the Order's strongest weapon. If people believe you can do something, after all, their belief tilts reality in your favour before you even begin to act.

=== Progenitors
The Progenitors are doctors and medicians within the Technocracy, dedicating themselves to biological sciences. Masters of the Sphere of Life, they employ the tools of genetic manipulation, hyper-advanced surgical techniques and sophisticated drugs to constantly push the envelope of medicine. They sometimes work closely with Iteration X, especially in the fields of cybertechnology and artificial body parts.


==== Focus
The intricate enigmas and potential of organic life provide the foundation of Progenitor techniques. Upon that framework, an individual Progenitor can build a wide variety of innovations. Although specific applications must be scientifically defensible (even if extremely loosely so), the Progenitors employ a dizzying variety of theories and Procedures. That said, those weird science techniques typically demand the presence of a well-stocked lab and intricate, often time-consuming, labour. Any tool that a healer, scientist, or naturalist would use can yield miraculous results in the skilful hands of a trained Technocrat, but the Progenitors usually need time and space to work their miracles.

/* To certain evolutionists, _Might is Right_, paradigm-wise. Most Progenitors, however, favor the agnostic Gaia-hypothesis approach to _Creation's Divine and Alive_. */ Cybernetics blend in with a hypertech approach to medicine-work, and the Convention's eclectic methods often seem like weird science by the standards of other Conventions.

=== Syndicate
A political bloc-turned-Convention, the Syndicate is one of the most reviled Conventions, even within the Technocracy. They control the flow of money and trade among the Masses as well as in the Union. This leaves them in a very unpopular position and they are often blamed for perceived shortcomings. The Syndicate knows, however, that they are the glue which keeps the Union together and that the Technocracy could not function without them.


==== Focus
Ars Cupiditae, the Art of Desire, provides the heart of Syndicate methodology. Refined by the High Guild during the medieval period, this portfolio of techniques focuses on self-mastery and social psychology. Essentially, the practitioner disciplines his own body and mind, refines relationship techniques, and establishes a kingdom around himself that he gradually expands into an empire of subtle but compelling influence.

Except in the most desperate circumstances, a Syndicate rep never resorts to vulgar Procedures; even then, those Adjustments employ high-tech weapons, martial arts, or other stylishly technological methods. Most often, a Syndicate Associate manipulates people and systems with subtle yet effective nudges -- phone calls, bribes, handshakes, perfumes, seductions, power lunches, PowerPoint presentations, hypereconomics, social domination, and so on -- that get other people to pull the trigger while the Associate tallies up the profits. /* _Might is Right_ in the Syndicate world; without it, civilization as we know it is on a _One-Way Trip to Oblivion_. */

=== Void Engineers
Explorers of wild frontiers on earth and beyond it, Void Engineers are cataloguing, taming, and assimilating the discovered dimensions into a safely controlled cosmos for the Masses to exist in. The Void Engineers, in addition to being dimensional scientists and explorers, are the first line of defence the Technocracy puts between humanity and the horrors man was not meant to know.


==== Focus
As every Engineer knows, only Tech Holds All Answers in A World of Gods and Monsters. Without imposed order, Everything is Chaos. And so, hypertech melds with cybernetics, craftwork, cosmic reality hacking, and a formalized type of weird science.

Mind-bending quantum physics, and the machines created to channel those physics, form the core of Wanderer beliefs. To that end, they adapt alien technologies and sanitized versions of ancient spiritual Arts, incorporated through reconciliation theories that bind those ideas and energies to scientific methods. In the Realms beyond Earth's limited reality sphere, Void Engineer technologies have all the subtlety of a big-budget science-fiction film. Blasters slide out of holsters, power-armour suits become essential, and titanic Universal craft (that is, spaceships) are the order of the day.
