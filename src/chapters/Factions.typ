=== Akashayana/Akashic Brotherhood
Harmony is found in the flow of What Is. To attune one's self to that flow is so simple that it can take lifetimes to master. It is, perhaps, the lot of man to strive against that flow; certainly, the modern world is filled with distractions from such purposes. And so, the Akashayana, commonly known as the Akashic Brotherhood, seek harmony in a world filled with chaos.

Deeply misunderstood among the Council as "peaceful warriors", devotees of the Akashayana Sangha ("Order of the Vehicle of Akasha") strengthen their bodies to cultivate their minds -- and, by extension, the Sphere of Mind -- in their pursuit of harmony. And yet, harmony often demands conflict. Just as the strings of an instrument must be struck before they can vibrate harmoniously, so too has the Brotherhood endured millennia of war. In the process, the Akashayana refined Do ("the Way", pronounced doe), the primal martial art from which all others descend.

Do, however, is more than mere war techniques. Encompassing a range of spiritual practices from tea ceremonies to Tantric union, Do focuses a person's essence, form, and intentions. Through relentless training, the student (or Akashi) develops the concentration he needs in order to discern the essential dissatisfaction of Samsara, the perpetual cycle or flow of existence. A Harmonious Brother (an honorific used regardless of the mage's gender) strives to help all beings realize samadhi (enlightenment, Ascension) and liberate each Bodhicitta (Avatar) from the cycle of rebirth.

Despite some misperceptions, the Akashayana did not originate in China. In a Time Before Time, humanity's world was a single Mount Meru; there, the Meru'ai people lived in harmony. It's been said that the Celestines Dragon, Tiger, and Phoenix taught the Meru'ai the disciplines that would become Do. Eventually, however, the imperfections of this world sundered Mount Meru from its celestial foundations, scattering the Meru'ai throughout the mountainous region later called Tibet. From there, they supposedly brought their language and ways to India, Nepal, China, and points east. Those origins have followed them wherever they go.

Over the millennia, countless teachers -- notably Gautama Buddha, "the Awakened One" -- have incorporated elements of Do into Buddhism, Taoism, Shinto, hatha yoga, and folk medicine. Akashi helped build Shaolin Temple and Angkor Wat; they overthrew tyrants, and their monasteries reached across Asia from Nepal to the Ryukyu Islands. In modern times, echoes of their teachings have spread worldwide.

Today, any mindful Brother can relive this entire history to better understand the cycle of continual remanifestation. The shunyata (primal emptiness) that underlies all things holds karmic traces of all past thoughts and actions. This imprint has several names -- Merumandala, Akashakarma, the Universal Consciousness, shared memory, and more; modern Brothers, though, call it the Akashic Record. A quiet mind, freed of ego, can sense the Record, in which all consciousness joins in a single stream. Once immersed in Akashic mindspace, a seeker's awareness helps him parse the collective memories of Akashayana throughout history.

That history includes awful times: the Himalayan Wars against the early Chakravanti; conquests and revolutions; the sect's murderous rivalries with the Wu Lung, Dalou-laoshi, and rival Akashic groups; the Boxer Rebellion and its opium- trade beginnings; Mongol invasions and Kamikaze Wars; the Screaming Ghost Purge and Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward. Akashics have trained samurai and disemboweled themselves for honor; they've raised katars with the Rajput, stormed the Forbidden City, starved in Pol Pot's Killing Fields, and turned to ash at Hiroshima. The outer calm of an Akashic masks deep pains and passions from every age and every conflict, and the dreadful karma from those times lingers even now.

Several constants link all Akashi, regardless of culture: discipline, which the study of Do demands; empathy, nurtured by connection with the Akashic Record; fitness, honed by the pursuit of Do; respect, sharpened by intense apprenticeships; and focus, without which one cannot attain even the most limited understanding of Do. Across the globe, they share the same terminology even when divided into different groups. The popularity of martial arts culture has brought many initiates to the Akashic Path; sadly, the modern world's various distractions make this a difficult Path for all but the most dedicated aspirants.

Today, the Akashayana face a bizarre challenge: their ancient enemies, the Wu Lung, seem to have chosen the Akashic way. Although the Brotherhood remains wary about this alliance, the Tradition's compassionate ethic encourages the Akashayana to give their old rivals a chance. To cope with that decision, though, some folks say today's Akashics will need what their Tradition has seldom prized and rarely cultivated: imagination.


==== Organization
The Brotherhood is essentially led by the Kannagara, monastic ascetics of the Phoenix Robe sect. Today, however, lots of power resides with the Shi-Ren ("Benevolent Aristocracy"), a faction of politically active traditionalists who want to expand Akashic influence in world affairs. Tradition mages in the West most often encounter warriors of the Vajrapani (derisively called "Warring Fists") and the eclectic iconoclasts of the Li-Hai, who seek enlightenment through heroic experience.


==== Initiation
At temples, ashrams, and dojos across the world, Sifus (Masters) and Sihings (Adepts) accept disciples who display open minds and serious purpose. Each teacher typically teaches only one pupil at a time. Akashic doctrine maintains that every person must find his or her way to enlightenment; as a result, Akashayana receive very little guidance or encouragement. Many frustrated pupils give up on this Path; those who persist, however, cultivate impeccable fitness of mind, heart, and body.


==== Focus
"Magick" is actually self-perfection and cosmic harmony. To master such Arts in the proper Way (Do), a person must expand awareness in all things, clarify thoughts, focus the body, and subdue emotional confusion. Asian alchemy, craftwork, faith, yoga, social dominion, and martial arts training allow a Brother to channel life energy (_chi_) toward astounding feats of physical, mental, and energetic achievement. As a result, common paradigms include _Bring Back the Golden Age_, _Everything's an Illusion_, _It's All Good_, and occasionally _Might is Right_.

=== Celestial Chorus
Heretics and idealists from the world's monotheistic creeds, the embattled Celestial Chorus heeds the voice of the Divine. All living beings, conjured and animated by the One -- by whatever name that One is known -- can join that Song and shape Creation. Defying their varied orthodoxies, Choristers teach that the Song has many harmonies. A person of faith can hear it and approach the One through different creeds. And for their tolerance, the Singers have endured a bloodied history of martyrdom.

Chorister liturgies tell of unity and division, triumph and heartbreak. The oldest plainsongs recount the First Age, the Shattering, when the One's pure unity was broken, and the First Singers, mortal heroes of boundless faith, who confronted and subdued the broken spirits of flawed entities. Pentatonic chants resurrected from Egypt's 18th Dynasty recall the blind priest Mentu- hetep, who brought Pharaoh Amenhotep IV to the worship of the Sun god, Aton. The Pharaoh's city, Akhetaten; his new name, Ikhnaton; his fellow worshippers, the Sacred Congregation, of disparate lands yet living in harmony -- of all these things and more the Chorus sings. Then their chant becomes a dirge: jealous priests of the old faith destroyed Ikhnaton's city and tried to wipe him from history. The Congregation dispersed across the Middle East.

And then, a rising melody, its counterpoint low and dark: For 16 centuries, diverse and fractious groups of Congregants grew in strength. First came Mithraic mystery cultists, guarded by Roman shields; later, after the Christ's Ascension, a sect called the Messianic Voices. To suppress corruption in the nascent Roman Church, Messianic mage Claudius Dediticius founded his Knights of Archangel Gabriel, Messenger of God. He could not have imagined that the Gabrielites would eventually become the Cabal of Pure Thought, forerunners of the Technocracy's New World Order.

Discordant notes herald the War Song: through simony and indulgences, king-making and cruelty, the Cabal amassed temporal power. Its rigid ways and rampant abuses, such as the barbarous Albigensian Crusade, drove away "heretical" magi. During the Western Schism, these Antinomians fostered new movements: Waldensians, Hussites, and the Heresy of the Free Spirit. They reached out to like-minded spirits in Isma'ili Islam and the Bektashi Order; to the Majestic Kings of the Zoroastrians; even to the Hindu nationalist scholar-warriors, the Vishnudharadhara ("Vishnu's Sword"). Such ecumenism was heretical, but Antinomians knelt to no Earthly authority, whether Church or State. And for this, they were hunted. The flames of the Inquisition burned hot. Meanwhile, in wars of words among themselves and of magick against Hermetics and the witch-folk, the Congregants faltered... if never in devotion, then certainly in progress.

A new harmony: Valoran, a French bishop hiding from the Inquisition, reunited the Messianic Voices and made peace with the Pagans. In 1461, with their gravest breaches healed, Congregants from every monotheistic faith presented a unified face to the Council of Nine as the Chœur Céleste.

Slow descending chords: as the Order of Reason rose, the new Chorus declined through persecution, massacres, and intolerance. To divide and conquer, the Cabal -- and later the NWO and Syndicate -- fostered centuries of culture war among the western faiths. And though fundamentalism strengthens the Chorus' paradigm (many Sleepers still believe in miracles), it also destroys the message of divine unity.

Even so, Choristers still preach that message. More to the point, they live it. Among the Traditions, the Chorus is perhaps the most compassionate... and it certainly speaks loudest, as a whole, for the welfare of the Masses. Although certain members can be fanatical, not even the primitivist Singers are religious fundamentalists in the way Sleepers understand that term. To hear more than the simplest notes of the Song -- and then survive within the Council -- a Chorister must transcend dogma and embrace faith. With regards to stickier theological nuances (the gender of Divinity, the limits of tolerance, the roles of Christ and the Prophet in the Divine plan, that sort of thing), modern Choristers deliberately avoid taking an official stance. There's plenty of tension in the ranks as a result, but at least no one's getting burned alive over it anymore!

It's not all peace and love, of course. Old wounds linger between this group and its companions. Out of necessity and faith, the Chorus still wrangles with this tricky alliance, debating where and when to draw lines with "friends" who practice loathsome Arts. Still, the Tradition's visionaries present the Council with proof of what united tolerance can bring. "We Sing in harmony", they insist, "and so might we all".


==== Organization
Hierarchical since the Roman Republic, the Chorus is led by its Curia, a 17-member synod of Chancellors and associated finance officers, tribunes, notaries, and liturgical commissioners. The most respected (or best connected) Chancellor holds the ceremonial position of Pontifex Maximus. Each Chancellor commands a territorial staff of Exarchs, sometimes called bishops. Exarchs supervise local leaders called Presbyters (priests or elders), who present this Tradition's human face.


==== Initiation
Presbyters seek recruits through social outreach in church organizations. Some worshippers spontaneously Awaken through powerful religious experiences, particularly those involving music. Each new apprentice, or Catechumen, undertakes rigorous instruction from an experienced mage called a Præcept. Like many forms of religious training, this instruction involves matters of doctrine, personal discipline, and -- obviously -- lots of singing lessons.


==== Focus
The Arts flow not from personal achievement or intent but from faith, unity, and harmony with the Divine Will. Singing -- especially many voices joined in harmony -- provides this Tradition's oldest and most important instrument. Chorister magick tends to manifest in light, fire, warmth, harmonic vibrations, and sublime music. _Faith_ and _High Ritual_ form the core of Celestial Chorus practices, so the group's paradigms include _Creation is Divine and Alive_, _Divine Order and Earthly Chaos_, and, of course, _It's All Good -- Have Faith_.


==== Bonus Asset

=== Cult of Ecstasy/Sahajiya
Consciousness is both a playground and a trap. Infinite in possiblity yet limited by necessity, the human mind is the seat of everything real... at least as far as human beings are concerned, anyway. And so, the Ecstatic Tradition expands reality by expanding consciousness. If you rearrange perceptions, they believe, you also rearrange potential.

To members of this "cult", magick flows from altered consciousness. A mind unfettered is a mind released from limitations and thus capable of anything. Because consciousness depends upon limitations in order to function, though, a mage must be able to slide in and out of an open state. Thus, Ecstatics have crazy eyes and eccentric manners that seem compelling yet frightening.

Despite their image as snugly hippie-kids, Ecstatics can be the scariest mages around. For starters, they're intense and unpredictable. Many are not, as the saying goes, good with boundaries, and they tend to say and do inappropriate things, like kissing enemies and laughing at pain. They're reckless by normal standards and often pull stunts that unAwakened folks could not survive. Passion is a sacrament they indulge to exciting and often uncomfortable extremes. "Extreme", in fact, is a good way to sum these mages up. They are, by definition, ex: outside, beyond, no longer a part of what has come before or after.

Often linked with the 1960s -- perhaps the high point of this group's influence -- ecstasy is among the oldest Paths on Earth. Primal humans, according to Cult lore, ate psychedelic mushrooms and thus opened the conflux between spirit, animal, and homo sapiens. Even now, Ecstatics see themselves as living gateways between flesh, spirit, and imagination, bound to all three and transcending each; in honour of their ancestors, many employ entheogens -- drugs that "open the god within" -- not as vices but as tools of sacred illumination.

Since those origins, Ecstatic mages have lived beyond the bounds of respectability, devotees of a left-hand path that embraces sex, drugs, music, dance, pain, pleasure, risk, and even death in the name of divine madness. Seers and shamans, rake-hells and prophets, these mages run with Sleepers who aren't afraid to go beyond. And yet, largely thanks to their reliance on extremity, Council Ecstatics have powerful ethics. The Code of Ananda -- the Cult's commandments -- forbids these mages from forcing their Path on unwilling partners. "Passions", the Code declares, "are the seat of the Self, and if they bleed, so too does the Soul".

More than their esoteric peers, Ecstatics enjoy the company of unAwakened folks. Challenging Sleepers to shake off that sleep, these mages favour art, music, and bohemian and neotribal subcultures -- environments where they can reward courage and inspire creativity. For a while, especially during its psychedelic heyday, this Tradition wore its "cult" moniker with pride. Recently, though, many Ecstatics have begun to feel limited by that flippant name. Cults have deluded, sinister implications in the popular imagination, so the group starts to favour its old title, Sahajiya (sa- HA-gee-AH, or "the Naturals"), as the new millennium dawns.


==== Organization
Informal and nomadic, this Tradition's loose structure reflects its focus on individual transcendence. It has several subsects but few leaders as such. Cultists tend to congregate at festivals, raves, concerts, and other tribal gatherings, mingling with "sleepwalkers" who tread the line between Sleeper culture and full Awakening. For the most part, this group favours influence over organization. Each Ecstatic is encouraged to follow his or her own Path, so long as that Path doesn't violate the sacred nature of other people. The only rigid element in the Sahajiya Path is the Code of Ananda and its emphasis on compassionate respect. Everything else is negotiable.


==== Initiation
_Five Steps to Ecstasy_: 1: Surrender your fear; 2: Focus your intentions; 3. Open yourself; 4. Attune yourself; 5: Repeat Step 1. To help a new Ecstatic into Step 1, a mentor challenges that person to leap beyond his fears and then use his intentions to fly instead of fall. Diksham -- the mentor/ student covenant -- provides a safe space for the initiate to learn magick and control. Often, mentors and students become lovers, opening a channel of intimacy and trust that goes beyond mere sex. That's not a rule, though, and compulsion is considered the worst sin an Ecstatic can commit.

After initiation and initial training, a mentor often pulls away from her student, trusting him to find his own way. She'll provide advice or secondary helpers, but she refuses to become a crutch. In order to grow along this Path, a mage must shape his own triumphs and mistakes.


==== Focus
"Get out of your own way" sums up the Ecstatic paradigm. To touch the Lakashim ("Divine Pulse"), a person must blow open the doors of inhibition and fear. Magick is the communion between a focused mind and the Lakashim -- a dance of possibilities directed by crazy wisdom. To perform it, an Ecstatic guides Ojas (life force) energy with conscious but flexible intentions. Ideally, a mage operates in a flux state in which neither time nor inhibitions block the life force -- aware of what she's doing and yet open enough to do anything.

The Cult's infamous substances and stimulations are meant to blow open mental doors and blast away obstacles to Enlightenment. That's the theory, anyway. In reality, those same tools can become obstacles in their own right. Smart Ecstatics, then, keep shifting their tools around to avoid stagnation and dependence on "the same old shit". Crazy wisdom is the core of this group's many practices, which include everything from gutter magick, yoga, and martial arts to cybernetic hypertech. And so, paradigms include _Creation's Divine and Alive_, _Everything is Chaos_, _It's All Good_, and quite often _Everything's an Illusion_.

=== Dreamspeakers/Kha'vadi
Earth has a voice. Not many folks can still hear it. Long ago, all people listened to that voice -- the beat of Life and the song of Spirit. Pride, however, has driven wedges between our world and the spirit realm. It takes strength and vision to hold on to that primal connection in spite of all the distractions of modern life... even more so when that modern world has tried everything in its power to break you. And yet, this Tradition and its people refuse to be broken.

Endurance is perhaps the best word to summarize the Society of Dreams. Its vision has endured. Its people have endured. The Tradition itself has endured ignorance, slavery, division, oppression, betrayal, marginalization, stereotyping, and a simplistic view from outsiders that has likewise endured long past all reasonable expectations. Aside from the group's staunch allies in the Verbena and Ecstatic Traditions (and often including them as well), the Council's view of the Dreamers has remained paternalistic and patronizing for over 500 years. And yet, they endure.

It's appropriate that this Tradition had not one founder but two. Naioba and Star-of-Eagles both heard the call of their spirits in very different lands, yet they transcended their differences to fall in love with one another. The sacred marriage between these female and male devotees inspired a diverse confederation of African, Native American, and Asian visionaries, for while that marriage was a ritual, the love involved was real. Although their romance ended with Naioba's assassination by a Vision-Mocker, that love, with its many symbolic ties, still holds the group together.

With few exceptions, the Kha'vadi ("those whose vision shapes the world") come from indigenous cultures or their technological descendants. Some embrace modern fashions and technologies, whereas others favour their ancestral ways. Though the Tradition holds a handful of European, Oceanic, and Asiatic spirit-workers, the vast majority of the group hails from Africa or the Americas. Often referred to by the Siberian word shaman, they're more properly thought of as medicine-people: folks who use natural healing gifts rather than selfish magick. Instead of bending reality to their will, the Kha'vadi work with reality... not the twisted reality of the Technocratic world but the deeper reality of the World Spirit in its many forms.

Thanks in part to its healer nature, this Tradition gets stereotyped as a bunch of bongo-beating throwbacks. That impression is absurd. Kha'vadi are spirit warriors fighting to save a sick world from itself. Especially in recent years, the Dreamers have become more militant than they've been for centuries. Groups like the Red Spear and the Ghost Wheel Society defy the Tradition's "stoic savage" image, with a newer faction, the Akinkanju ("Unbroken") even lobbying to toss out the Council's "slave-name" and replace it with a self-determined title. This age, after all, is a nightmare, and the 'Speakers have had enough of it. Some wounds need to be cleansed with fire.

These days, a new vista offers fresh hope: the Internet -- a global connection network with its own spiritual aspect. Computer-minded Kha'vadi realize that the Digital Web has a consciousness... and by extension, a soul. The practical tools of social media allow Dreamspeakers from across the world to meet up and reconstruct their roots, and the spiritual side of the Digital Web nurtures a growing technoshamanic movement whose possibilities and repercussions reach further than anyone, even the 'Speakers themselves, can imagine...


==== Organization
Although the shamanic Path tends to be solitary, medicine-people can be quite social. And so, this Tradition combines a respect for autonomy with the supportive network of a tribe. For centuries, many Dreamspeakers preferred to wander their own roads; in recent years, however, the group has returned to the community-centred focus of many pre-imperial cultures. Separation, after all, has been a liability. With stronger bonds between them, the 'Speakers share a greater voice.

In previous ages, Dreamspeakers met in distant corners of the spirit world -- even forming Realms where the Old Ways remained untouched. Recently, however, the Unbroken Folk have turned their focus to the material world, meeting in both rural and urban settings, often gathering at powwows, hip-hop shows, block parties, and neotribal festivals. Social media groups, too, provide meeting grounds for the new breed of Dreamspeakers. In all cases, the previous solitude has shifted toward a more social focus.

Even so, Kha'vadi remain distinctly informal. Elders are respected by their younger peers, but youthful vigour feeds the future and earns its own sort of respect. The long- winded titles favoured by the  Council sound stupid to the average 'Speaker. Deeds and wisdom speak louder than laws.


==== Initiation
Like his Tradition, a Dreamspeaker survives apparent death. Part of his initiation involves ritual (sometimes literal) demise; that passing brings the shaman into the spirit realm, where he faces trials and challenges. Assuming he survives that ordeal, the kaimi ("initiate") becomes a so-cha ("disciple") and returns to the mortal world with fresh insight and greater vision.


==== Focus
Medicine, not magick, is the essence of Dreamspeaker Arts. An avatar is Howahkan: the mysterious voice that speaks to those who are ready to hear it. Sorcery is an egotistical and ultimately destructive Path that leads people away from the Good Road of harmony with the World Spirit. To reach past the illusions of mortal life, one must listen to Creation's heartbeat, face death, and remain open to the voice through which all life speaks.

Practice-wise, 'Speakers favor medicine-work, craftwork, shamanism, crazy wisdom, and faith. A few pursue cybernetics, yoga, Voudoun, and witchcraft, but their companions often shun them. Common paradigms include _A World of Gods and Monsters_, _Creation's Divine and Alive_, _Bring Back the Golden Age_, and sometimes _Might is Right_.

=== Euthanatoi/Chakravanti
Death is not an end but simply part of a larger cycle. Life picks up where death leaves off, and death finishes what life begins, bringing it back around for another go at things. Sometimes, a life becomes toxic to everything nearby. At that point, death becomes a blessing... a blessing the Euthanatos Tradition is ready to bestow.

The Euthanatos... or, more correctly, Euthanatoi... see themselves as keepers of the Wheel. That's a problematic duty, with fear and corruption its perpetual companions. The will to live is strong, and so the "good death" mages often find themselves cast in the murderer's role. Even the kindest of them -- the ones who become medical professionals, priests, grief counselors, and so forth -- spend most of their time around death and its complex passions. Each member of the group has himself died and been reborn. In a literal sense, the Euthanatoi carry a bit of death everywhere they go.

The group's name itself has been problematic. Aside from the mangled Greek in its common form, that "good death" title has defined the Tradition in murderous terms. Many Thanatoics prefer the old name, Chakravanti, or "people of the Wheel". As the Council moves toward its new form, the pressure to return to that name -- or to choose another, Niyamavanti, "people of our Rule", that lacks the baggage of those old names -- increases. After all, if individuals can reincarnate themselves, why shouldn't the Tradition based around reincarnation do the same?

Reincarnation forms a vital part of this Tradition. These mages don't just believe in it -- they know from personal experience that reincarnation exists. Rooted in a fusion of reincarnationist creeds from India, Greece, Africa, Tibet, and elsewhere, the group keeps the Great Wheel spinning. In the old days, this was easier. People lived, they died, they joined the Wheel and returned to live new lives. But between the spread of one-life creeds, materialist atheism, resuscitation techniques, titanic wars, and the sheer number of living and dying people, the Great Cycle has been jammed. Abominations like vampires and other undead things have multiplied. The material and spiritual realms have been packed with ghosts of many kinds, and although the Avatar Storm might have offered a housecleaning of sorts, the Wheel has required... shall we say, more direct forms of maintenance. And so, reincarnationists have, all too often, been forced to become killers. Even so, life, not death, is the true heart of this Tradition. Above all things, the Wheel must be maintained.


==== Organization
Like their Verbena and Ecstatic allies, the Chakravanti pursue a sometimes sinister Path that other mages often fear and rarely understand. Yet among the Traditions, this group is perhaps the most ethical. Their awful responsibility demands no less. The group's strict code -- the Dharmachakra, or "Eight-Spoked Wheel of the Law" -- emphasizes the Cycle (Samsara); unity of all things (Advaita); acceptance of mortality (Kala); responsible guardianship (Pravitra); self-control (Dama); compassion (Daya); avoidance of temptation (Tapas); and the personal experience of death and rebirth (Punarjanman). Although the group itself lacks rigid hierarchies, all members of this Tradition are expected to know and follow this code, on pain of final death and removal from the Wheel.

This strict code requires strong bonds between mentors and initiates. As a result, although the death-Tradition contains many different sects, the relationship between a teacher (Acarya) and her student (Chatra) is essential. The Chatra swears a Vrata ("life-oath") to both his mentor and to the Tradition as a whole. Breaking that oath disgraces not only the student but the teacher as well... and compels the Acarya to hunt her student down for punishment.


==== Initiation
Each Thanatoic mage undergoes the Diksha: a ritualized physical death. Returning from the Shadowlands, that person undergoes a long apprenticeship that includes memorizing the Niyama and learning the many arts of healing, fate, and murder. Such apprenticeships can last for years and typically involve quests, tests, and challenges in which the student confronts the awful implications of his Path. Without that awareness, after all, a "death-mage" is exactly what people think he is: a monster who's everything this Tradition has sworn to destroy.


==== Focus
As masters of life, death, Fate, and Fortune, the Euthanatoi view magick as an extension of the Cycle. By turning the Wheel, these mages control probability as well as the forces of mortality. That turning focuses on the cyclical nature of existence, and so a Chakravat uses practices and instruments like crazy wisdom, faith, High Ritual, medicine-work, reality hacking, martial arts, shamanism, and occasionally Voudoun to direct those energies toward the desired end. Yoga has an essential place in this Tradition's Arts. _Divine Order and Earthly Chaos_ might be the group's most common paradigm; others include _Everything's an Illusion_, _Creation's Divine and Alive_, and even, believe it or not, _It's All Good -- Have Faith_.

=== Order of Hermes
Just as Solomon bound spirits to his bidding, as Merlin raised a stable boy to kingship, as John Dee named Elizabeth's realm an Empire and then anchored it in time and space at Greenwich, so too do the Houses of Hermes turn the hidden wheels of the world. Their Arts are the most refined, their knowledge the most exhaustive, their Wills the most dedicated to excellence. In many minds (most especially their own), the Order of Hermes defines the word mage.

As the largest and most organized Tradition, the Order of Hermes has influenced -- they would say "defined" -- the Western experience of magick. Hermetics command a huge range of secrets and wards. Their wealth is vast, their Wonders potent, their libraries breathtaking. The Order boasts the greatest number of Chantries, Masters, and Archmages. Its achievements include the first codification of magickal study, the formulation of the Spheres, and, indeed, the formation of the Traditions themselves.

Still, the Order has faced setbacks and catastrophes: the loss of both its greatest Chantry, Doissetep, and its leading Master, Porthos Fitz-Empress; the extermination (some say "self- destruction") of its most powerful luminaries; the devastation of priceless archives. Yet the reaction from other Traditions appears to be a collective sigh of relief. Why?

Because Hermetic wizards are, to a one (and to a fault), meticulous, pedantic, majestic, and haughty. The Preface to the venerable Hornbook -- a thick volume presented to each new apprentice -- captures this attitude in one paragraph: "What mage in any rival Tradition, of whatever skill, can boast the comprehensive knowledge of our least Adept? What other mage can offer any shred of theory to support his magick? The aboriginal shaman with his drums and rattle gives over his body to a spirit he knows not. The cleric with his song begs like a child for the favor of deities. The Ecstatic with his vice burns like a meteor and vanishes, and the witch with her blood-rites aspires only to procreate. Even the Akashic with his meditation and exercise seeks passive contentment in false belief. Meanwhile, the Hermetic with firm Will commands, "Do!" And it is done".

This bombast reveals the Order's obnoxious confidence; the average Hermetic can back it up, too. Among the Traditions, only the Verbena and Dreamspeakers have as violent a history with the hated Technocracy. It's no accident that the Craftmasons (themselves formed from a renegade Hermetic sect) chose to initiate hostilities by blowing up one Hermetic citadel and to stage the Convention of the White Tower in another. Nor is it an accident that Master Baldric LaSalle chose to host the Mistridge Tribunal -- the first step toward the Grand Convocation -- in the ruins of that first attack. An Ecstatic might have provided the inspiration, and the Verbena might have secured new allies, but the Order of Hermes forged the foundation upon which the Traditions have been built.

Even rival Traditions accept the Order's vast and spectacular history. In ancient Egypt, two auspicious precursors invented the alphabet. Archmagus Solomon bound many spirits that still serve the Order today. Pythagoras founded the cult of Hermes in Greece. The Corpus Hermeticum, attributed to Hermes Trismegistus ("Thrice-Great Hermes"), forms the basis of the modern Tradition. Even Sleepers recall a few Hermetics from those storied times: Merlin. Paracelsus. Saint- Germain. Cagliostro. From Gandalf to Crowley to Potter, the popular acceptance of magick has arisen from Hermetic archetypes. In the new millennium, the group enjoys more popular acceptance than ever before. The Masses might not pursue the Hermetic Arts, but in a subconscious sort of belief, they accept the Order's ways as the face of Western wizardry.

And so, though their various setbacks have cost the Order dearly, Hermetic mages greet this age with renewed vitality. The loss of the Archmages, the destruction of Doissetep, the war against vampires, the purge of corrupt House Janissary... they're all like the collapsing Tarot Tower: the shattering of bondage that compels transformation. This age's Hermetics are rolling up their sleeves and remaking the Order from its foundations while keeping those foundations -- confidence, knowledge, excellence, and Will -- intact. Guided by a vision of the City of Pymander -- the ideal of global Ascension under Mystic Will -- Hermetics remain committed to perfection. Given their high purpose, they can accept no less.


==== Organization
The Order is rigidly hierarchical, disciplinarian, and regulated. The Code of Hermes and its Peripheral Corrigenda dictate behavior, protocol, rules for certámen challenges, and the proper inscriptions for Chantry doorways. Thirteen Houses still exist as factions in the Order's endless, brutal infighting. Some Houses predate the Norman Conquest (Bonisagus, Flambeau, Quaesitor, Tytalus, Verditius, and the catch-all Ex Miscellanea); others are newer, even quite recent (Fortunae, Hong Lei, Ngoma, Shaea, Skopos, Solificati, and Xaos).


==== Initiation
Recruited from academia, esoteric religious orders, science, or the military, a student must survive a punishing apprenticeship under an unforgiving mentor (a mater or pater). The Order recognizes nine Degrees of mystic advancement: Neophyte, Zelator, Practicus, Initiate, Initiate Exemptus, Adept, Adept Major, Magister Scholae, and Magister Mundi. The training aims to provoke, by the conclusion of the Third Degree, a gradual Awakening more akin to a process than to a single jolting moment.


==== Focus
A Hermetic mage commands nothing less than the keys to the universe. And so, these consummate scholars master ancient and arcane rituals through constant study and intense practice. Tapping elemental currents through incantations, signs, seals, paraphernalia, and secret languages, the Hermetics are -- by necessity -- secretive and suspicious. They command tremendous power, after all, and their rivals lurk everywhere.

Alchemy, dominion, and High Ritual form core practices within the Order's ranks. No Hermetic mage lacks such training. Certain Hermetics add chaos magick, the Art of Desire, hypertech, craftwork, weird science, yoga, and occasional malficia to that core, pursuing such paradigms as A Mechanistic Cosmos, Divine_ Order and Earthly Chaos_, _Might is Right_, _Tech Holds All Answers_ and, naturally, _Bring Back the Golden Age_.

=== Society of Ether/Sons of Ether
The only thing holding humanity back from achieving its yearned-for Utopia is the smallness of its imagination. So long as individuals allow society and its rulers to dictate the size and extent of their dreams, mundane boredom and all its attendant suffering shall persist. Even the magickal imaginations of most of the Nine Traditions are hampered by what was allowed them in times past by the Powers That Be, whether those powers were shamans, pharaohs, or priests. Only the future is free of these chains, unset and as yet undreamt of. Only the truly bold can make the future real in the present, and the Etherites are nothing if not bold!

A society of radical technomantic dreamers, the original Sons of Ether proved unfit for the confined and suffocating paradigm of the Technocracy. Although they adopted their current name at the turn of the 20th century, these Enlightened Scientists are both sons and daughters of their rallying theory: that of Ether, that subtle substance that lies behind the guise of all phenomena in the universe. Long criticized as a boys' club due to its early Victorian customs, the Etherites have progressed over the years. Although hardliners still insist upon propriety, the term Society of Ether has largely replaced the shopworn masculinity of the group's original name.

The Etherites trace their lineage back to ancient Troy, although few outside the Tradition accept this claim. Their foundation of natural philosophy was reputedly established among the pre-Socratic thinkers of Greece and the Mediterranean, recorded in a book titled (by its Islamic translators) the Kitab-al- Alacir, or Book of Ether. As the first Inspired (that is, Awakened) attempt at a systemic natural philosophy, the Kitab is revered by Etherites, many of whom Awakened when reading it.

From a loose intellectual tradition practiced by disparate individuals, the group finally gained a societal foundation with the establishment of Hermetic House Golo in Medieval Italy. This eventually became the Natural Philosophers Guild, and then, in the Victorian Era, the Electrodyne Engineers, whose fascination with the novel power of electricity promised to liberate the common man from physical and metaphysical darkness. Such idealism remains the heart of this Tradition. The Technocracy could not crush it. World wars could not purge it. Neither skepticism nor failure nor claims that Etherites are all mad and reckless can prevent these luminaries from bringing their magnificent Science to the world.

Yes, by the standards of most people (even those lunatics with whom they share company), most Etherites are eccentric. Bizarre. Perhaps even mad. But such madness is the flare of a nova encased by an all too human shell. In a world determined to be small, the Society of Ether breeds heroes. If those heroes demolish labs, companions, even... um, cities... upon occasion, such casualties are the cost of true Enlightenment. And the world is improved thereby. Is not the current age proof of this? Flying machines! Recording technology! People no longer die by the thousands from plagues or starvation! (Well, perhaps except in those lands without much Science... a pity, that.) And so, despite its costs and obstacles, the Sons and Daughters of Ether remain dedicated to the advancement of wondrous Science!

In the 21st century, this Tradition has come into its own. The influence of science fiction -- especially its Etherian offshoot, steampunk -- in popular culture allows them to stand proudly at the forefront of human endeavors. Among all Traditions, only the Virtual Adepts (and sometimes the Akashayana) enjoy similar allowances from Paradox. Modern reality favors this weird Science, and although Etherites occasionally overreach themselves and suffer the Paradox Effect anyway, the Society of Ether manages to get away with... well, "murder" is such an ugly term. Let us say, instead, magnificence.

As far as their fellow Traditions are concerned, most Etherites seem like selfish egotists, pushing paradigms wherein individuals can excel while leaving the Masses behind. Only the Etherites (so they insist) seek to bestow the benefits of Awakened Science on everyone. "All, or none!" is their creed. As a result, they strive for recognition -- not only from their Enlightened peers but from the Masses most of all. Such acceptance, they know, reflects the striving human spirit -- a spirit that looks toward Tomorrow and the many marvelous Things to Come.


==== Organization
Etherites, despite their boisterous talk about society, are often fractious and competitive. Fellowship exists as an avenue for seeking praise; criticism merely prods you to go back to the lab and do better next time. Although many Etherites bury themselves in research for weeks on end with very little companionship, they eventually seek the company of their peers, no matter how obsessive their work becomes.


==== Initiation
Prospective Etherites tend to be selected by true Scientists, based on some sign or evidence of latent genius. These prospective initiates receive a test designed to force them to confront the implications of their ideas. Most often, the would-be Scientist is left to discover a copy of the Kitab-al-Alacir, whose concepts often serve to Awaken the spark of bigger, brighter accomplishments to come.


==== Focus
Science! Or, more accurately, an imaginative grasp of natural principles channeled through established physical and energetic technologies. Earthier than their Virtual Adept colleagues, these technomancers prefer to employ Science that can be seen, held, demonstrated, and confirmed even by the eyes of fools. To that end, Etherite Science is showy, romantic, and gracefully futuristic, even if that future looks more like classic science fiction than like mundane science fact.

As a practice, an Etherite may use anything that seems to work. Most Scientists, however, favor gloriously esoteric variations on alchemy, craftwork, cybernetics, hypertech, reality hacking, and, of course, weird science. Paradigms focus largely around concepts like _A Mechanistic Cosmos_, _Everything is Data_, _Might is Right_, and _Everything's an Illusion_, but they usually boil down to _Tech Holds All the Answers_.

=== Verbena
Life is shit and piss and blood. Pain and pleasure are inevitable birthrights. Our spirits are not some transcendent separate thing but are instead the raw vitality of Life itself. Drawing from among the oldest mystic understandings, the Verbena Tradition views life as a wondrous, implacable cycle -- a dance of elements in which a mage calls tunes but cannot herself resist the dance. This view scares the living hell out of most folks, and that's just how many Verbena like it. If you can't hang with the truth, they figure, just get the fuck out of the way!

Like the herb for which they're named, the Verbena (or, more correctly, Verbenae) excel at healing, divination, and purgation. No other Tradition understands Life magicks the way they do. Masters of shape-changing, animal affinities, plant craft, and weather work, Verbenae stay close to Nature in her truest forms... and some of those forms can be bloody indeed. Although it's rare, the Verbenae have been known to practice animal and human sacrifice. More often, they carve runes in their own skins, endure hideous ordeals, subject themselves to painful deprivations, and perform other acts of self-sacrifice in order to avoid harming other beings. Every Verbena grove has a World Tree, the living symbol of Creation as a whole. These trees have been stained red by the rituals performed in those groves; the darker the red, the more powerful the grove.

Although the Tradition itself formed in the 1400s, Verbena roots run far deeper. Like many mystic societies, these mages trace their origins to primal humanity's beginnings... and in their case, they're probably correct. The primordial Wyck, they say, embodied the first fusions of spirit, mind, and flesh. Essentially gods, they soon guided the first human beings toward wisdom and magick. The Old Ways, say these traditionalists, are the inheritance left by those entities, and the Verbenae -- and perhaps the Dreamspeakers -- are its truest heirs.

These Old Ways are, by most standards, harsh. Blood, sex, passion in its rawest forms -- these are the tools most Verbenae prefer. Cold iron, worked wood, fires kindled with your bare hands, natural clothing, organic foods... the simpler it is, the more powerful its effects. Although some Verbenae make concessions to the modern world -- cars, guns, perhaps a favorite TV show or two -- this Tradition, by and large, remains stubbornly archaic. And though they can be compassionate in their way, Verbenae have no time or patience for weakness. To them, the comforts of a technological world breed sickness and laziness. d"Until you spend a month", they'll tell you, d"in the wild with nothing but the clothes on your back... or better yet, without them... you don't know jack shit about reality".


==== Organization
Covens -- often numbering 13, nine, seven, or three -- make up this group's foundation. Solitary Verbenae exist, but most members of this Tradition prefer to work in groups. Women probably outnumber men overall, and they're granted more respect here than in most other groups. Many female mages gravitate toward this Tradition for that reason. Two leaders (taking priest and priestess roles although both might be male, female, or transgender) govern the larger covens, with a single witch in charge of three-person groups. Covens tend to favor older members over younger ones, and old-school covens can be quite autocratic. Although disputes often get resolved through votes, those votes might involve ordeals, tests, or combat.

This Tradition respects strong bloodlines. And so, whenever possible, Verbena covens follow family lineage. Each coven has a grove, though that grove might be a garden in the leader's back yard. Large meetings occur eight times a year, during the two equinoxes, the two solstices, and on Imbolc (Feb. 2), Beltane (May 1), Lammas (Aug. 1), and Samhain (Oct. 31). Plenty of Verbenae also gather at Christmas (Dec. 25) and on July 1, especially as shifts of climate and culture blur the distinction between Nature's seasonal cycles.


==== Initiation
Verbena newcomers undergo a ritual death and rebirth. An intense period of study, testing, and meditation climaxes in a distressing ordeal -- sometimes illusionary, often real. If and when the coven members are satisfied with the initiate's trustworthiness and dedication, they call the elements as witnesses. As they were during the Burning Times, most Verbenae remain loyal unto death.


==== Focus
Verbena Arts concentrate on doing a lot with very little. Their tools are practical as well as symbolic, with uses that reach back to antiquity. "Pagan" in every sense of that word, these magicks hold deep ties to Nature. Shape-changing, transformation, healing and injury, divination, purification, growth and withering, natural cycles, and the tricky ways of Fate are witch-folk specialties.

To all Verbenae, _Creation's Divine and Alive_. Because Creation, life, and divinity aren't particularly nice, other common Verbena paradigms include _A World of Gods and Monsters_, _Might is Right_, _Bring Back the Golden Age_, and _Everything is Chaos_. Witchcraft is the group's core practice, with certain individuals favoring Voudoun, dominion, weird science, chaos magick, yoga, martial arts, High Ritual, cybernetics, the Art of Desire, craftwork, medicine-work, and even organic hypertech.

=== Virtual Adepts/Mercurial Elite
What is real? When you see something, touch something, know something, is it real, or is it simply a collection of signals, bits of information, pieces of data that come together in your mind and make you think "This is real"? To the Virtual Adepts, everything -- buildings, tools, plants, animals, people -- can be represented as information. Figure out the code behind something, the Adepts claim, and you can figure out how to manipulate that thing, how to change it, improve it, or delete it. Since information is abstract, you don't even need to touch the thing you want to change. If you know it, you can adjust it just by changing the code. And you can change the code from anywhere.

The youngest Tradition began as a Technocratic Convention that was alienated by its former allies. Too radical for their peers, these Difference Engineers questioned too much and aspired too far. And for their presumption, they were punished; Alan Turing, an elite mathematician and cryptographer, was disgraced and destroyed. His death created a martyr, and that martyrdom -- combined with other persecutions -- led to the Engineers' defection and their rebirth as the Virtual Adepts.

That Technocratic past left a stigma that many mages remain unwilling to ignore. In return, most Adepts scorn the primitive methods of the other Traditions. Humanity, the Adepts believe, should not be subjected to limiting philosophies like religion, government, or nature. Instead, the Adepts strive toward a technological singularity in which humanity's limitations get dumped as people remake themselves into something better, brighter, and post-human. Why focus on getting back to nature or praying to absentee gods, after all, when you can change the world -- and yourself -- so that you no longer need nature and can become a god?

As their moniker implies, Virtual Adepts spend lots of time in a virtual world. If you can interact with other people or even control objects of the real world from your online telepresence, then why bother with the dismal reality of a leaky apartment building and a body made of limited, mortal meat? Even in this banal Meatspace, however, Virtual Adepts surround themselves with computers, monitors, digital notepads, smart phones, and all the latest technological toys. The most elite among them, though, have learned to manipulate reality without tech... a feat that highlights the group's command of the God Code inside Creation.

For all their futuristic acumen, these Adepts still consider themselves mages in the classic sense. Their Arts remake reality through vision, technique, and Will. A modern Adept might not call what she does magick (though many of them do), but she regards herself as a child of Mercury, the Trickster/Messenger God in the Machine. Like the Adepts, Mercury is everywhere at once, undermining assumptions with the audacity of his Arts. Especially in this era, when technology is both a road to freedom and an instrument of oppression, the world needs audacious tricksters. And so, the Adepts of the 21st century are growing far less virtual and far more real.


==== Organization
Merit-respecting anarchists, Adepts avoid standard organization and loathe conventional hierarchies. In the '90s, they based respect on eliteness: a form of peer recognition won through attitude and accomplishment. Though the tradition has matured and diversified since then, an Adept's personal achievements -- rather than titles or seniority -- still mean everything in this group's esteem. Cleverness, wit, technological creativity, and an astute sense of sociological reform mean more than a snappy handle or a keen online icon. There's a special reverence for Adepts who tear down oppressive social structures... and a vituperative loathing for ones who support such structures in Meatspace or the online world.


==== Initiation
Virtual Adepts have a socially brutal initiation process. The idea of physical deprivation, master-apprentice challenges, or meditative spirit quests strikes them as absurd. Instead, Adepts typically give their aspirants and initiates cryptic missions to sabotage authoritarian structures, steal classified data, and create amusing pranks that undermine corrupt bastards and expose pompous windbags. At some critical juncture, the initiate gets left to fend for herself; a suitably imaginative (and hopefully stylish) resolution to the problem earns the accolades of peers and a place among the Adepts. In short, then, most Adepts enter the group through the grand Internet tradition of trolling.


==== Focus
_Everything is Data_. Thus, in this _Mechanistic Cosmos_, every tool or practice an Adept employs focuses on shaping, altering, manipulating, gathering, storing, collating, influencing, or destroying information. Such tools range from the obvious computer gear (generations ahead of conventionally available tech), clouds, holograms, implants, nanotech, energy drinks, and sense-altering stimuli to the understated chic of dark hoodies, manga-influenced haircuts, fashionable androgyny, and provocative masks. All Adepts, however, keep the implements of their technomagick handy. For many Adepts, computers are a more important part of one's identity than any attire or accessory. An Adept's personal devices are almost always the most heavily customized and stylized elements of that Adept's ensemble.

Perhaps the most accomplished reality hackers alive, this Mercurian Elite also employs various forms of cybernetics, hypertech, weird science, martial arts, chaos magick, gutter magick, and sometimes shamanism, Voudoun, crazy wisdom, or witchcraft with a technological flair.

=== Iteration X
Humans are weak, but technology makes us strong. Over generations, scientists have augmented humans with state-of-the-art tech, improving bodies and minds. Mass media disseminate news about these new inventions in order to uplift the Consensus; the greatest innovators of such enhancements, though, perfect their creations in absolute secrecy. Under the aegis of the "Clockwork Convention", elite Technocrats create hypertech devices in secluded laboratories and then deploy them to the Front Lines of an improved reality. Through many iterations of such progress, Enlightened visionaries develop integrated masterworks to surpass mere humanity, striving to meet their greatest challenge: artificial intelligences that can replace the flawed human mind. These Enlightened Scientists seek cybernetic perfection; with each generation, their creations improve. The state of the art is the current incarnation of Iteration X.

Refined over millennia from visionary artisans to posthuman mechanistics, Iteration X commands the most impressive firepower and most disciplined military capacities in the Union. Its military operatives boast weaponry as integral parts of their bodies, from energy-packed blasters to kinetic chain guns. Various enhancements make these agents faster and stronger than their all-too-human rivals. Meanwhile, clones conditioned in laboratories and trained as Kamrads bolster their ranks. Such operatives pride themselves on efficiency, each individual working as a part of a much larger machine.

Despite the Convention's military rep, not all Iterators are soldiers. This Convention also specializes in innovation, hyperefficiency, mass production, and statistical prediction. Some of the group's most visionary work is virtual, not physical, relying upon elaborate simulations and organic/ mechanical integration technologies. Enlightened analysts simulate endless variations of events to predict outbreaks of anomalous phenomena, supernatural deviance, and other chaotic disruptions before they occur. Some operatives refine diverse skill sets, coordinating various operations through interconnected thought processes. Others appear perfectly mundane but are anything but that when you get beneath their skins.

The Convention's most dangerous agents and weapons remain too advanced for Earthly Consensus; developed in remote facilities (off world, whenever possible), these armatures are shipped in from labs and factories filled with sublime hypertech. In the old days, the machine-realm called Autocthonia represented a near-mythic reflection of sublime perfection. New-millennium Iterators seem less dogmatic about cybernetic refinement -- perhaps because Autocthonia fell victim to a Dimensional Anomaly, or maybe just because "Borging out" doesn't seem quite as cool as it used to be. Even so, certain Iterators believe full Empowerment is possible only within such realms. When humanity Ascends, they believe, all of reality will be recast in mechanistic perfection.


==== Organization
Iterators employ chains of command that dictate missions with mathematical precision. Ideally, the operatives and their Convention work as parts of a larger machine, setting aside autonomy and ego. Both agents and supervisors are expected to perform to their utmost ability, sacrificing themselves, when necessary, for the greater good.

Among the lower ranks, Socially Conditioned Iterators work exclusively with one another, refining their teamwork and proving their value. Successful agents gradually achieve free will, greater trust, upgrades, enhancements, and cross-Convention assignments that reward efficient flexibility. Experienced Iterators learn to critique and question their superiors but also to wait until the right moment to do so. For most Iterators, gray areas are unacceptable; instead, each action becomes a binary choice, swiftly evaluated as either success or failure.

Repeated failures condemn an Iterator to serve time as part of a mindless machine. The lowest-ranking operatives are little more than tools, and a powerful cyborg who cannot manage his resources must temporarily surrender his autonomy to more efficient external management.


==== Initiation
Sophisticated calculations (that is, Time-based Procedures) help Iteration X recruiters find likely personnel before those people reach Enlightenment. Soldiers, scientists, mathematicians, philosophers, and even people with profound physical handicaps all provide suitable personnel, so long as they can accept an essential role in a greater whole. Previously Awakened recruits are rare, but they can be Socially Conditioned to accept assimilation. Once a potential initiate has been removed from the distracting imperfections of the Masses, a complex process of indoctrination, surgery, and enhancement shapes each Iterator into an effective and often Enlightened operative. Failed experiments, meanwhile, get deconstructed into Kamrads and Ciphers, creating an army of obedient workers and soldiers who act in unison toward programmed goals.


==== Focus
The core of Iteration X science comes from the synergy between organic, mechanical, social, mathematical, and psychological elements. And so, cybernetics, craftwork and hypertech forge the foundation of this group's practices. Innovative Iterators employ martial arts, social dominion, hypereconomics, and reality hacking -- after all, even perfection must be flexible! A few even hold a demi-religious faith in the ultimate potential of The Machine; these days, though, they don't often discuss that out loud.

_A Mechanistic Cosmos_ presents the obvious paradigm for Iteration X. Clearly, _Tech Holds All Answers_. Math- inclined members of this Convention assure their comrades that _Everything is Data_. This group has no use for "fuzzy" paradigms, so the Sphere of Dimensional Science is an extremely rare discipline among its ranks.

=== New World Order
Knowledge grants power, and true knowledge should be restricted to those with the appropriate respect for the power it contains. As masters of information and indoctrination, the agents of the New World Order alter data to enforce their vision of a perfect world. Masses, as these Technocrats understand, remain safest when they're kept blissfully, ignorantly asleep. Humanity prospers best in a world where deviance is hidden, science is predictable, and controlled technology empowers those people who have the training to handle it.

The group's now-infamous name comes from the philosophies of 18th-century idealists. Proposing a global state in which random elements such as primitive societies, art, magic, and even religion were abolished in favor of benevolently imposed order, these heretical masters began disseminating the concept through secret lodges and assorted allies across the world. During Queen Victoria's reign, this group consolidated its power within the existing Cabal of Pure Thought. Moving that group from a religious foundation to a secular one, the idealists purged their superstitionist peers through campaigns of truth reform and rhetorical intrigue. Reason replaced religion as the paragon of their newly ordered world. Joining forces with Inspector Rathbone's Skeleton Keys, those idealists forged their metaphorical Ivory Tower with London at its center and Victorious Britannia its figurehead. By the time American conspiracist Robert Welch began spreading the term among the Masses in the early 1970s, the New World Order was many decades old.

The bedrock of this group involves control of information… and thus, of possibilities. To this end, the Convention employs a three-pronged strategy: eliminate dissent and Reality Deviance, consolidate information and Enlightenment, and propagate the image of a safely governed world. Using all three elements to reinforce one another, the Order strives to bring chaos to heel. It's a titanic labor, to be sure, and one in which open conflict remains undesirable. Therefore, the NWO prefers covert action to overt action. Beneath a cover of secrets and misdirection, the rampant elements of deviant reality can be taken down, erased, and revised to fit a more productive truth.

Information provides the cornerstone of NWO operations. And so, the Order employs advanced surveillance, field agents, and data-tracking processes to collect and assimilate intelligence throughout the world. Meanwhile, those field-agent teams also hunt down deviant elements for elimination or recruitment. Captured RDs get subjected to intense Social Conditioning sessions -- refinements of the same Conditioning that errant members of the Technocracy undergo in order to bring them back into line. By the end of that programming, those Deviants either join the Union as productive citizens or else become will- broken ragdolls in the Order's hands. Either way, they no longer threaten the Consensus.


==== Organization
Reflecting that three-pronged strategy, the NWO employs three primary Methodologies to implement its goals. The Operative group sends agents -- typically the Black Suits, though it employs less obvious agents too -- into the field to address threats and collect intelligence. The Ivory Tower handles administration and implementation throughout the entire Technocracy and also disseminates controlled truths through Sleeper academia. Meanwhile, the Watchers collect information, simultaneously circulating messages of control and complacency among the Masses so as to minimize chaos and dissent. All three agencies report to upper-echelon supervisors, who direct operations from safe distance.

Meanwhile, two other Methodologies -- Q Division and the Feed -- provide support for the other operations. Technically a cross-Convention imperative, Q Division provides the field gear for Technocratic agents (NWO and otherwise), and the Feed assesses and guides the growing power of the Internet and its many social technologies. Within all NWO divisions, an ascending order of seniority (Black Suits/ Gray Suits/ White Suits) reflects what the Order calls the "purification of genius" and the formality of control.


==== Initiation
By reviewing standardized academic and vocational tests, scanning databases, and coordinating covert surveillance efforts, the Ivory Tower selects potential recruits. Generally, a new recruit dies to his oldlife and enters a newlife as a NWO trainee. Other recruits get converted from among the Union's enemies, by way of the Order's sophisticated Social Conditioning techniques.

Because these tactics can be very resource-intensive, the NWO bolsters its ranks with clones: unEnlightened constructs trained to act in unison, empowered with a telepathic hive mind, and chemically altered to disintegrate upon death. As a matter of course, the NWO subjects its agents to varying degrees of indoctrination and social conditioning, depending on individual performance and their roles out there in the field.


==== Focus
In _A World of Gods and Monsters_, _Might is Right_ and _Tech Holds All Answers_. Social dominion and the command of consciousness -- that is, the influence, harnessing, programming, and reprogramming of the homo sapiens mind -- provides the cornerstone of this New World Order's techniques. To that end, psychic training, information manipulation, perceptual conditioning, and symbolic connections (like a man wearing a formal black suit and carrying a badge) provide the essential tools for NWO Procedures. Physical media constitute the second level of manipulation, with the third and most brutal level -- force -- channeled through guns, armor, gadgets, hypertech vehicles, advanced weaponry, and the martial arts training all operatives receive. Paranoia, however, is the Order's strongest weapon. If people believe you can do something, after all, their belief tilts reality in your favor before you even begin to act.

=== Progenitors
Gods do not create and destroy life. Scientific laws do. With an understanding of such laws, then, nothing separates a man from a god. In fact, given the errant nature of gods, a dedicated scientist can improve on the decidedly unintelligent designs of natural selection and thus become greater than the capricious divinities of legend. The Progenitors -- those Technocrats working toward beginnings -- understand that the only things standing between flawed evolution and a new, improved strain of organic life are the understanding of organic principles and the willingness to reshape them to one's own design.

Originating in the esoteric and often forbidden mysteries of life and death, this Convention retains the scary allure of its witchy forebears. From bloody-handed midwives and dirty-fingered herbalists to the hunters and domesticators of nature's rough beasts, the Progenitors share their beginnings with the mystic Verbenae. But whereas the earthy Pagans kept their craft wrist-deep in entrails, the embalmers and physicians of the classical era studied the workings of mortality and the methods of transcending it. Medicine came first, followed by the manipulation of living organisms: adaptation, mutation, artificial limbs and organs, chemical enhancements… the possibilities seemed limited only by technology and fear.

But fear's a powerful force. Despite their many victories and cures, these physicians remained pariahs among the terrified cattle they sought to save. Even when the healer Hippocrates established his Cosian Circle in ancient Greece, mortal terror haunted the practitioners of those fearsome arts. The descendants of that Circle joined the Order of Reason during the medieval era, but not even their tireless work to cure that age's plagues could save some Cosians from flames and censure. Is it any wonder, then, that Progenitors tend to hold a chip on their collective shoulders?

When Darwin's work popularized what the Cosians already knew -- that life is organic adaptation, not divine providence -- the Cosians adapted as well. Shedding their classical trappings in favor of Victorian formalism and the budding scientific method, these small-p progenitors continued to push the boundaries of healing and mutation. The First and Second World Wars gave them plenty of material to work with, and though some of those experiments were… shall we say, unethical… the data gained from 20th-century conflicts vaulted the Progenitors to the horizons of organic potential.

These days, a Progenitor enjoys clean facilities and bleeding -edge technologies developed far outside Earth's invasive ecosystems. Healing, cloning, genetic manipulation, viral evolution, chemical consciousness, biological mutation, animal crossbreeding, accelerated and controlled evolution, compound synthesis… their list of projects and accomplishments makes Iteration X look dull. Despite their reputation -- even within the Union -- as "Frankensteinians", these visionaries retain the courage and imagination of their ancestors, bravely shaping new worlds from primal materials and fresh technologies.

==== Organization
Throughout its various Methodologies (Pharmacopoeists, Genegineers, FACADE Engineers, and the cross-disciplinary Damage Control), this Convention follows an academic hierarchy. UnEnlightened facilitators (janitors, lab assistants, receptionists) provide support for the ascending ranks of Students, Research Associates, Primary Investigators, Research Directors, and the mysterious Administrators. A ruthless but unEnlightened contingent of field and street operatives (backed up by the Conventions' considerably more capable collection of clones, constructs, Victors, biomodified agents, and bestial projects) provides muscle when needed. The most versatile Progenitor agents learn techniques and Procedures from all of these disciplines, developing formidable arsenals of scientific knowledge.

Advancement through those ranks demands constant study, research, and innovation. Students must pass many tests, eventually providing and defending a thesis that demonstrates her mastery of Enlightened Science. Success means promotion to progressively higher levels, levels at which the various scientists contend for grants and resources. Investigators spend copious amounts of time working with teams of other agents to prove their loyalty and usefulness to the Technocracy. As one would expect, if they can't publish successful results for the Union, they might perish for their failure.


==== Initiation
This Convention prefers to find potential recruits before they Awaken. Working with the Ivory Tower, Progenitor supervisors analyze standardized tests and search databases to find clever scholars with budding potential. (Recruiting Progenitors after their Awakening is more difficult… but the Union offers answers for troubled minds.) Promising recruits get tagged before medical school, sponsored with scholarships, and offered a chance for something more. If a recruit accepts, she receives training above and beyond what the Masses can offer; if she refuses, then the entire episode gets wiped from her mind and she just has a bad quarter, defined only by hazy recollections and a lingering feeling that she missed something grand. In the worst cases, the student ODs on recreational drugs or suffers stress-based suicide. The Progenitors hate to waste good material, but life isn't always fair.


==== Focus
The intricate enigmas and potential of organic life provide the foundation of Progenitor techniques. Upon that framework, an individual Progenitor can build a wide variety of innovations. Although specific applications must be scientifically defensible (even if extremely loosely so), the Progenitors employ a dizzying variety of theories and Procedures. That said, those weird science techniques typically demand the presence of a well-stocked lab and intricate, often time-consuming, labor. Any tool that a healer, scientist, or naturalist would use can yield miraculous results in the skillful hands of a trained Technocrat, but the Progenitors usually need time and space to work their miracles.

To certain evolutionists, _Might is Right_, paradigm-wise. Most Progenitors, however, favor the agnostic Gaia-hypothesis approach to _Creation's Divine and Alive_. Cybernetics blend in with a hypertech approach to medicine-work, and the Convention's eclectic methods often seem like weird science by the standards of other Conventions.

=== Syndicate
Money is power -- not only because of what it can buy but because the very idea of money defines what people are worth. Words like "value", "wealth", and yes, "worth" reflect the influence money holds in human society. We define ourselves and view others in ways often based on fiscal ability. Notions of class and style depend upon the things that money can buy. And so, in many ways, the Syndicate is the most powerful group on Earth today.

You wouldn't know it to hear the scuttlebutt. After all, popular misconception links the word "syndicate" with the lowlifes of organized crime. A common image of Syndicate operatives depicts them as gangsters -- dangerous, certainly, but no match for true Enlightenment. And although there's some truth to that impression (illegal goods, after all, are profitable), it's a carefully maintained camouflage that cloaks the true scope and power of this Convention. On the few occasions when a Tradition mage crosses paths with an obvious Syndicate rep, bullets are sure to be exchanged. What that pitiful sorcerer never understands, though, is that the gun-toting bully is as close to the halls of influence as most spell-slinging weirdoes ever get. The real power, meanwhile, rests comfortably in executive offices high above the fray.

In many ways, the Syndicate has always run the Technocracy. Where else, after all, would the Craftmasons have gotten the funds to build their cannons? How else could the Explorators have constructed their ships? Artisans and priests and knights all need money in order to purchase the tools and toys of which they're all so proud. And since the earliest days, that money has come from the vaults of the High Guild. In return, the Guildsmen extracted taxes, tithes, and plunder at the same time that they set the agendas… and, quite often, the very realities… that governed the other Conventions. Though the Guild seldom got its own hands dirty, its operatives and funds spread the group's influence across the human world.

Stripped of its gangland connotations, the word syndicate refers to "those who bring things together". When the Order of Reason transformed itself in the 1800s, the High Guild (whose name, guild, refers to payment in gold) assumed that word as its name. While other Technocrats experimented in labs, chased Reality Deviants, or pushed the boundaries of science into the 20th century, the Syndicate brought them all together through the power of wealth. Bankers, tradesman, politicians, and the occasional criminal tied the world into a single profitable enterprise, linked by global commerce, diplomacy, and media. From the international shipping companies of the imperial age to the pervasive corporations of today's world, the Syndicate has literally banked on human progress. And so, although most of the Ascension War has pitted Black Suits and HIT Marks against desperate superstitionists, the Syndicate has consolidated the world into a handful of associated corporations… most of which it controls.

This sounds sinister… and yet, without trade and money, culture as we know it would be impossible. Language and mathematics evolved through trade; technologies spread through commerce; regulated monetary systems helped civilizations expand and prosper. Even Jesus understood the importance of "rendering unto Caesar what is Caesar's". Money and its attendant benefits are the rewards earned by hard work and imaginative enterprise. It stands to reason, then, that the people who understand those systems best should be the ones who benefit from it most.


==== Organization
Organized like a corporation (or perhaps it's the other way around…), the Syndicate descends in a top- down pyramid. At the apex sits a CEO and 10 Vice Presidents of Operations (VPOs) who head the Board; from there, the various Chairmen (or Vision Men) answer to the Board, supervising each Construct and Symposium. Managers answer to these Chairmen, and Associates (or Magic Men) answer to the Managers. Those Associates comprise the lowest rank of unEnlightened Syndicate ops, with Providers (a.k.a. Our Friends or simply Staples) rounding out the lowest duties and handling most of the busywork at the bottom of that pyramid.


==== Initiation
Talent, hard work, industrious imagination, and a gift for playing hardball mean everything in this Convention. Recruits often come from offices or business schools where scouts watch for rising stars… especially ones who are deeply in debt, incredibly skillful, or both. After a series of interviews, the would-be recruit is tested, employed as a Provider, and groomed for ruthless acumen and personal responsibility. If and when a prospective Associate reveals that she controls money rather than letting money control her, she receives a promotion to the head division. There, she begins to learn the secrets of desire and the means to manipulate reality's bottom line.


==== Focus
Ars Cupiditae, the Art of Desire, provides the heart of Syndicate methodology. Refined by the High Guild during the medieval period, this portfolio of techniques focuses on self- mastery and social psychology. Essentially, the practitioner disciplines his own body and mind, refines relationship techniques, and establishes a kingdom around himself that he gradually expands into an empire of subtle but compelling influence.

Except in the most desperate circumstances, a Syndicate rep never resorts to vulgar Procedures; even then, those Adjustments employ high-tech weapons, martial arts, or other stylishly technological methods. Most often, a Syndicate Associate manipulates people and systems with subtle yet effective nudges -- phone calls, bribes, handshakes, perfumes, seductions, power lunches, PowerPoint presentations, hypereconomics, social domination, and so on -- that get other people to pull the trigger while the Associate tallies up the profits. _Might is Right_ in the Syndicate world; without it, civilization as we know it is on a _One-Way Trip to Oblivion_.

=== Void Engineers
The cosmos are vast and dangerous. Like the savage frontiers of old, the many dimensions must be tamed, catalogued, and assimilated into a safely controlled cosmos. At worst, they should be sealed away so that the monsters on the other side cannot disrupt the Consensus… which they have a nasty tendency to do whenever they get the chance. That void must be engineered -- not merely tolerated, but transformed. And since the Renaissance, this Convention has understood that goal and worked to shape chaos into stability.

In the tenuous balance between humanity and the Void, this Convention maintains a careful (and sometimes unsuccessful) foothold. Originally founded as two separate groups -- the Celestial Masters and the Explorators (a.k.a. the Void Seekers) -- the Convention discovered that the promise of Heaven Above was a lie; instead, a trackless Void stretched off into infinity, ripe with horrors that made the hells of Dutch painters look insignificant. As Explorators mapped out the mysteries of the human world, Celestial Masters began exploring that Void. In the late 1800s, the groups merged into a single faction. Its duty: to chart the mysteries and keep them from polluting the Earth.

On one hand, the Engineers pursue an imperial agenda of conquest and sterilization; on the other, they're not wrong about the threats they confront. No Technocracy Convention has nearly as much hands-on experience with the unspeakably counterrational Otherworlds and their equally ineffable hosts. The brain-twisting expertise of this Convention has allowed the Technocracy to shut down Nazi invocations, Marauder reality storms, and Reality Deviant strongholds. The Technocracy owes its Horizon Constructs, ectoplasmic disruptors, machine realms, and sentinel satellites to these Engineers, whose Border Corps Division steps in where cyborgs fear to tread. Most of all, perhaps, the Union owes its supply of Quintessential energies to this convention. And so although the Wanderers (an old name that still applies) might be the loosest cannon on the Technocratic gunship, they're a damn powerful force, politically and otherwise.

The Void Engineers hold one goal above and beyond all others: defend humanity against everything beyond the Gauntlet. To that end, high-tech laboratories maintain barriers against unauthorized crossings; heavily armed marines seek and destroy anything that crosses that line. Alien incursions, mystical spirits, astral entities, and ghostly apparitions all pose threats to the safety of the human race, but the Void Engineers possess the tools and talent to oppose them all. And although most Technocrats hate to admit this, legions of extradimensional entities already hide throughout the human world, entrenched on the Front Lines of the battle for reality. Void Engineers track them down, using specialized training to hunt exotic prey.

To tip the balance between order and chaos, Void Engineers prefer to know their foes. They lead expeditions to extradimensional realms to study impossible creatures in their unnatural habitats. For the sake of survival, they'll recruit Technocrats from other Conventions to assist them, but Void Engineers insist on leading the way. Research provides a common goal, of course. When the fate of the world's at stake, however, a preemptive strike can buy a little more time for humanity.

Given these alien environments and pursuits, it's not surprising that Engineers seem kind of odd. All too often, operatives return from off-world assignments as hollow-eyed malcontents in need of social processing. Indeed, the Wanderers have their own sanity division, the Descartes Institute of Mental Health, where Earthbound Social Processing is broken and replaced with a more suitable mentality. Despite their longstanding image as freewheeling space hippies or hammerheaded star-grunts, this Convention boasts many of the Union's most dedicated and accomplished members. Each Engineer, regardless of her post, is a scientist; all other duties remain secondary.


==== Organization
Especially in the wake of the Dimensional Anomaly, Void Engineer groups follow military-style ranks: Technicians, Marines, and Cadets form the lowest echelon, graduating upward to become Enforcers (who guard the borders), Explorers (who chart new territory), Investigators (who pursue scientific inquiries), or Researchers (who develop new tech). Higher-ranking personnel within these levels assume command of individual units. At the highest level, a series of Coordinators handles the logistical and administrative responsibilities, overseeing the Convention as a whole. (Note: In an Avatar Storm metaplot, this Convention changes drastically; see Convention Book: Void Engineers for details.)


==== Initiation
Recruiting personnel from among top-level researchers, tech geeks with an eye for unconventional applications of science, and folks who feel disappointed by science program cutbacks, the Engineers bring their Cadets off-world to specially designed training and research facilities. From that point onward, a Cadet is considered initiated whether or not she ever achieves Enlightenment -- she's seen too much to ever be considered mundane again.


==== Focus
As every Engineer knows, only Tech Holds All Answers in A World of Gods and Monsters. Without imposed order, Everything is Chaos. And so, hypertech melds with cybernetics, craftwork, cosmic reality hacking, and a formalized type of weird science.

Mind-bending quantum physics, and the machines created to channel those physics, form the core of Wanderer beliefs. To that end, they adapt alien technologies and sanitized versions of ancient spiritual Arts, incorporated through reconciliation theories that bind those ideas and energies to scientific methods. In the Realms beyond Earth's limited reality sphere, Void Engineer technologies have all the subtlety of a big-budget science-fiction film. Blasters slide out of holsters, power-armor suits become essential, and titanic Universal craft (that is, spaceships) are the order of the day.
