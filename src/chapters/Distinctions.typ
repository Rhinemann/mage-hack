  Who are you and where do you come from? What do others remember about you? How are you described to others in the tales told of your adventures? You are the grand sum of your distinctions. Every PC starts with three distinctions rated at #c_sym.d8. You always include one of your distinctions in your dice pool. Which one you choose may have a part to play in the outcome of your test, contest, or challenge.

  Each distinctions belongs to one of three groups:
  - Your personality & life before Awakening

  - The Awakened group you are affiliated with anf your position in it

  - Your focus through which you perform magick

  Each of your distinctions benefits from the Hinder SFX by default, and may have a number of SFX locked as well.

    == Personality & Sleeper Life
    Who were you before you Awakened, and who are you now, having realised the inner workings of reality? Your personality & sleeper life distinction describes your life before Awakening and your main character trait or quirk that defines you as a person. Most PCs will have their vocation and some adjective or a catchphrase as a part of this distinction.

  #block(breakable: false)[
    == Awakened Affiliation
    Who are your people in the Awakened world? After you Awakened you changed, a truth of the world opened up to you, you now belong to a group of other Awakened or are fending for your own. Awakened affiliation distinction represents your position in the awakened world, your Tradition, Convention, Craft, as well as other partnerships in the supernatural world are described here, as well as your standing in those contexts.

    == Focus
    How do you do magick? There's more to magick than just Awakening and having the right Spheres. Every mage has a unique set of beliefs - their paradigm, ways to employ their magick - practice, and tools through which they do so - instruments, together they form your focus. Focus distinction explains how your character does magick.

  == Creating Distinctions
  Some players may have trouble creating distinctions on their own. For help in building distinctions, this section presents three tables and the guidelines for using them. The three tables are the Descriptor Table, the Noun Table, and the Catchphrase Table. You can use the tables however you want, whether as lists to pick from or as random tables you pull from by rolling dice, but there are suggested guidelines for using them below.

  *To Make Your Personality & Sleeper Life Distinction,* choose or roll a descriptor from the Descriptor Table, and then add it to a noun. The noun can be one summarizing your character's ancestry, culture, career, heritage, or background (such as Swordsmith, Parisian, Ranger, or Clone), or one you choose or roll from the Noun Table. Together, the descriptor and noun form your personality & sleeper life distinction distinction. Alteratively roll from a

  *To Make Your Awakened Affiliation Distinction,* choose or roll a group from the Tradition, Convention or Craft Table, and then add a descriptor to it. The descriptor can be one defining a, pursuit, quirk, reputation, or identity (such as Relentless, Treasure-Hunting, Agoraphobic, Monstrous, Bionic, or Egyptian), or one you choose or roll from the Descriptor Table. Together, the descriptor and noun form your second distinction.

  *To Make Your Focus Distinction,* choose or roll a paradigm from the Paradigm Table and then add one or two practices and a number of instruments. Practice and instruments may be created by the player or rolled from respective tables. Practice makes your focus distinction. You are encouraged to add a more detailed description, including the instruments and the paradigm used for this distinction.

  *To Use the Descriptors Table,* choose any descriptor on the table, or you can roll randomly. If you roll, first roll a #c_sym.d12 and find the row for the resulting number. Then roll a #c_sym.d4, and find the column for that result. Your random descriptor is where the row meets the column.

  *To Use the Nouns Table,* choose any noun on the table, or you can roll randomly. If you roll, first roll a #c_sym.d12 and find the row for the resulting number. Then roll a #c_sym.d4, and find the column for that result. Your random noun is where the row meets the column.

  *To Use the Catchphrases Table,* choose any catchphrase on the table, or you can roll randomly. If you roll, first roll a #c_sym.d8 and find the row for the resulting number. Then roll a #c_sym.d4, and find the column for that result. Your random catchphrase is where the row meets the column.

  *To Use the Tradition table,* choose any Tradition on the table, or you can roll randomly. If you roll, roll a #c_sym.d10 and find the row for the resulting number. Your random Tradition is on that row.

  *To Use the Convention table,* choose any Convention on the table, or you can roll randomly. If you roll, roll a #c_sym.d6 and find the row for the resulting number. Your random Convention is on that row.

  *To Use the Craft table,* choose any Craft on the table, or you can roll randomly. If you roll, roll a #c_sym.d12 and find the row for the resulting number. Your random Craft is on that row.

  *To use Paradigm Table,* choose any paradigm on the table, or you can roll randomly. If you roll, first roll a #c_sym.d6 and find the row for the resulting number. Then roll a #c_sym.d4, and find the column for that result. Your random paradigm is where the row meets the column.

  *To use Practice Table,* choose any practice on the table, or you can roll randomly. If you roll, first roll a #c_sym.d6 and find the row for the resulting number. Then roll a #c_sym.d4, and find the column for that result. Your random practice is where the row meets the column.

  *To use Instrument Table,* choose any seven Instrument on the table, or you can roll randomly. If you roll, first roll a #c_sym.d10 and find the row for the resulting number. Then roll a #c_sym.d6, and find the column for that result. Your random instrument is where the row meets the column, repeat that 7 times to get your full instrument list.
