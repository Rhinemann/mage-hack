= What is Mage?
#title_content is a tabletop roleplaying game of urban fantasy, gothic punk, ambition, freedom, power and shifting realities built on rules inspired by _Cortex_. The simple yet extremely powerful and encompassing rules will allow you to experience a familiar world of _Mage_ with new and exciting rules that are closer to modern narrative games.

In a tabletop roleplaying game such as this one, players each take a role of a character or multiple. #title_content characters exist in a world much like ours, but darker, painted in gothic tones and punk sounds. The shadows are darker, the urban decay stronger, and the inequalities highlighted. Mages, vampires, demons, werewolves and countless occult creatures inhabit the shadows. They walk among mortals and pretend to be them, all while navigating their own complex worlds of intrigue, politics, secret wars and mysteries.

== Who Are You?
You play as a mage, a person who can reshape reality through the sheer force of will. In a moment of clarity you Awakened to your potential and the true, mutable nature of reality, and such you are able to change the very reality with your belief and Awakened Will.

And you are not the only one. The world is filled with others just like you, forming spanning conspiracies and secret cultures. Mages walk among mortals and monsters, waging the age-old secret war over reality itself. Mystic mages of Crafts and Traditions combat the march of technology stewarded by the Technocracy and their vision of global progress, as reality is defined by the collective belief of humanity.

But as you can see by the very device you're reading this on, Technocracy is the dominant force in the world, who in their success calcified reality and human belief more and more, forcing every mage into the shadows, lest they be rendered apart by the static, opposing forces of human beliefs for performing the wonders of magick and hypertechnology in clear view.

And now you are one of those extraordinary people, so who will you be in this world of mystery and strife?
