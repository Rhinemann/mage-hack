Roadmap:
- [x] Expand on Paradox pool, write out the ways of managing it and spending Paradox dice.
- [x] Elaborate on stress recovery instead of referencing the handbook.
- [x] 
  Something like this, maybe? Just my initial creative hunches, you'll have a better sense of if these all fit your build, but if you can get five customizable SFX like this set up, adapting all five to each to individual sphere and it's five die ratings should go relatively smoothly. (Obviously, the stuff in double parentheses is all placeholders to be filled in with specifics.)

    --- 
    :d4:
    SFX: ((Name)). Step up your lowest die on any roll to sense ((sphere-related stuff)) or create a related asset.

    :d6:
    SFX: ((Name)). On rolls to ((exert the basic level of control provided by a :d6: rating in this sphere)), add :d6: and step up your effect die.

    :d8:
    SFX: ((Name)). Spend a :PP: to create a :d8: ((whatever kind of ongoing advantage a :d8: rating of this sphere creates)) asset.

    :d10:
    SFX: ((Name)). Spend a :PP: to step up or double your sphere die on a roll to ((exert the greater level of control provided by a :d10: sphere rating)).

    :d12:
    SFX: ((Name)). Take :d6: ((appropriate stress or complication)) to double your die for this sphere on a roll. On a failure, step up ((the same stress or complication you took to activate)).
